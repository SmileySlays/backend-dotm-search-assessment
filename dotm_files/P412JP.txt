Dear Name/DNC/Correspondence Address-Contact Greeting:

We are pleased to report that the above-identified Japanese patent application was published in the Japanese Official Patent Gazette on date under Publication No. number.  If no opposition is filed within three months from the date of publication and/or the Examiner finds no new reason(s) for rejection, a decision to grant this application will be issued.  At that time, the registration fee for the first three year period will be due to the Japanese Patent Office.  Unless we hear from you to the contrary, the registration fee will be paid once it becomes due.

We will report further on this application as the case progresses.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions. 

Sincerely,
