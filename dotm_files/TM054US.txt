Dear Contact Greeting:

We are enclosing a copy of the Notice of Acceptance and Notice of Renewal for the above-identified trademark registration.  The term of the registration is thereby extended for an additional ten years, i.e., until RENEWAL TERM 5100.  Although we will mark our docket for the renewal deadline, we suggest that you include this deadline in a docket of due dates in your own records so that it will come up for attention sufficiently in advance of the deadline for appropriate steps to be taken at that time.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney

Enclosure
