Dear Name/DNC/Correspondence Address-Contact Greeting:

We are pleased to inform you that the above-identified patent application in Argentina matured into Patent No. number on date for a term of fifteen (15) years, therefore expiring on date.  While there is no requirement to mark, it is advisable to mark products made in accordance with the patent, as well as associated packaging and literature, with "Argentine Patent No. number.  A consequence of not marking is that under certain circumstances a patentee may not be able to recover damages for infringement.

An annuity must be paid each year to maintain the patent in force until its expiration date.  The first annuity will be due on date.  We will attend to payment of this annuity unless instructed otherwise.  Assuming all annuities are paid, this patent expires date.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. 

Sincerely,



Case Data/Team Member/Working Attorney
