Dear Contact Greeting:

We are pleased to report that the above-identified PCT application has entered the national phase in Canada.  We will report the serial number and filing date for the application once the Official Filing Receipt is received from the Canadian Patent Office, probably in a few months.

Annual maintenance fees are payable beginning on the second anniversary of the International Filing date.  We will request your instructions as the maintenance fee deadline approaches.

We will report further on this application as it progresses.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
