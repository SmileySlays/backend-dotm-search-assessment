	Australia Design Patent Registration No. Registration No. issued Registration Date
	Title:	CASETITLE

Dear Contact Greeting:

We are pleased to enclose the design patent for the above-identified case in Australia. The term of the design patent is ten years from the date of filing, therefore expiring on Term Calc. A single renewal fee is due five years from the filing date. While there is no requirement to mark, it is advisable to mark products made in accordance with the patent, as well as associated packaging and literature, with "Australian Design No. Registration No.". A consequence of not marking is that under certain circumstances a patentee may not be able to recover damages for infringement.

There is no formal requirement to work (i.e., exploit) the registered design in Australia. However, failure to work the invention at any time after three years following registration may leave the patent open to the grant of a compulsory license. Importation of the patented product or products made abroad by the patented process (if applicable), is regarded as working in Australia. 

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. 

Sincerely,



Attorney

Enclosure
