Dear Correspondence Address-Contact Greeting:

We are pleased to enclose the original Mexican Patent Certificate for the above-identified patent case in Mexico.  The term of the patent is twenty years from the date of filing, therefore expiring on  term date 87500 .  

Annuities are required to be paid in January of every fifth year, covering five years at a time.  We will contact you for instructions regarding payment of the annuities as they come due.  

In addition, Mexico has a “working” requirement for the product to be made available to the public in Mexico within three (3) years of patent issuance.  Importation into Mexico of the patented product or of a product made by the patented process is equivalent to working.  Failure to file proof of working (or failure to file a valid excuse for non-working) before Foreign Use Due Term 31400  will open this case for compulsory licensing.  Therefore, we plan to alert you by Foreign Use Due 6 Mo. Prior Term 31410 so that whatever is needed can be done before the deadline, but we strongly recommend that you enter the Foreign Use Due 6 Mo. Prior Term 31410date in your own calendar to be sure that appropriate steps are taken by that deadline.

Please confirm receipt of this patent document by signing and returning a copy of the enclosed form to us for our records.  If you have any questions regarding this patent, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
