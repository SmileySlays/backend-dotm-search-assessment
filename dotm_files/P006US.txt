Dear Contact Greeting:

This is simply a follow-up regarding the status of the above-identified matter. As a reminder, a first draft of a patent application for this case was forwarded for review. After being instructed to hold this file, we confirmed that we would contact you periodically to see if work should be resumed, which is the purpose of this letter.

It is important to note that the ability to obtain a patent can be significantly affected by the passage of time. For example, it is not possible to file a patent application on subject matter which has been publicly disclosed, or which has been sold or offered for sale, for more than a year. It is also possible that an application will be filed by others claiming the same subject matter, which could undermine your rights. The potential for loss of rights is even greater with respect to possible patent protection outside of the United States.

We therefore urge you to let us know at your earliest convenience if you wish to file this patent application. We look forward to receiving your instructions, which you may conveniently provide by checking the appropriate option below.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter further before deciding how to proceed. 

INSERT AFTER CLOSING:

	Yes, we want to proceed with a patent application. We will be in contact to discuss this further.

	No, we do not wish to proceed with an application. Please close your file on this matter.

	We have not decided whether to proceed with a patent application. Please follow up again in _____ months.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
