regarding the filing of the Combined Section § 8 & § 15 Declaration.Declaration of Use Under Sections 8 & 15

Section 8

	A Section 8 Declaration of current use is a sworn statement, filed by the owner of a trademark or service mark registration, confirming that the mark is presently in use in commerce. If the owner is claiming excusable nonuse of the mark, a Section 8 Declaration of Excusable Nonuse may be filed. The intent behind the requirement for the Section 8 Declaration is to remove from the Register (of trademarks and service marks) marks which are no longer in use. The United States Patent and Trademark Office will cancel any registration on either the Principal Register or the Supplemental Register if a timely Section 8 Declaration is not filed by the current owner of the registration during the prescribed time periods. 

	The owner of the registration must file a Section 8 Declaration by the end of the sixth year after the date of registration. The window for filing opens on the fifth year anniversary of the date of registration. Additionally, a Section 8 Declaration is required at the end each successive ten-year period after the date of registration as part of the registration renewal process. A six-month grace period is provided in which to file the Section 8 Declaration, upon payment of the required surcharge (for late filing) and the required fee. This results in a total of eighteen months during which the owner may file a Section 8 Declaration.

	A Section 8 Declaration must include:
	1.	The registration number and the date of registration;
	2.	The name and address of the current owner;
	3.	The fee for filing the Declaration;
	4.	If the mark is in use, a statement that the registered mark is in use 
in commerce, a list of the goods/services recited in the registration on or in connection with which the mark is in use, and one specimen per class of goods/services. Examples of acceptable specimens are tags/labels for goods and advertisements for services; and
	5.	A signed and dated affidavit or declaration.

Section 15 

	A Section 15 Declaration is a sworn statement, filed by the owner of a mark registered on the Principal Register, claiming “incontestable” rights in the mark for the goods/services specified. Marks registered on the Supplemental Register are not eligible for claims of incontestable rights under Section 15. An “incontestable” registration is conclusive evidence of the validity of the registered mark, of the registration of the mark, of the owner’s ownership of the mark, and of the owner’s exclusive right to use the mark with the goods/services.

	The filing of a Section 15 Declaration is optional. An owner may choose to claim the benefits of incontestability by filing a Section 15 Declaration or may elect to retain the registration without those benefits. The term of the registration, for purposes of renewal, is not affected in either event.

	A Section 15 Declaration may not be filed until the mark has been in continuous use in commerce for at least five consecutive years subsequent to the date of registration. The Section 15 Declaration must be executed and filed within one year following a five-year period of continuous use of the mark in commerce.

	A Section 15 Declaration must include:
	1.	The registration number and the date of registration;
	2.	The fee for each class of goods/services in the registration to which the Declaration pertains;
	3.	A statement that:
a.	The mark has been in continuous use in commerce for a period of five years subsequent to the date of registration on or in connection with the goods/services recited in the registration and is still in use in commerce;
b.	There has been no final decision adverse to the owner’s claim of ownership of the mark for the goods/services, or to the owner’s right to register the mark or to keep the same on the Register; and
c.	There is no proceeding involving the claimed rights pending in the U.S. PTO or in a court of law and not finally disposed of; and		
4.	A signed and dated affidavit or declaration.
