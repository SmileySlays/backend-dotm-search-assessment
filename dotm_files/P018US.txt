Dear Contact Greeting:

We have received and are pleased to enclose the Official Filing Receipt showing the application number and filing date of the above-identified reissue patent application.  This receipt should be carefully preserved in your files as the original record of the filing of the application in the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).  

It is desirable that the application number and filing date of the patent application be kept confidential until the announcement in the Official Gazette (the official journal of the USPTO), at which point this information will be publicly available.  Based on current conditions in the USPTO, we estimate that the first official action will be received no sooner than one year from now.

Until a reissue application is granted, the original US Patent No. Patent/Registration No. remains in effect.  Therefore, you should continue marking any products covered by the issued patent.

ADD IF NOTICE TO FILE MISSING PARTS ALSO RECEIVED
We have also received a Notice to File Missing Parts in the above-identified application.  The deadline for submitting the signed declaration of the inventor(s) is Term 49005.  We look forward to receiving the executed Declaration which was forwarded with our recent correspondence.

We will notify you upon receipt of any further communication from the USPTO regarding this case.  If at any time you wish to check with us concerning the status of this application, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
