Dear Contact Greeting:

We are pleased to report that we have obtained approval of the above-identified application from the Trademark Examiner.  This approval was published in order to notify third parties of the intention of the Trademark Office to issue a registration on the mark.  No member of the public has opposed registration, and we therefore have received a Notice of Allowance. 

To complete the registration procedure, it is necessary that the mark be in actual use in interstate commerce.  A Statement of Use, along with evidence of use, must be filed in the Trademark Office on or before TERM 20600.  If the mark has been put into use, please complete the enclosed worksheet and return it to us along with a specimen showing use of the mark.

If the mark will not be in use by the deadline, it is possible to obtain an extension of time.  Regardless of whether the mark is or is not in use, please let us hear from you.

Sincerely yours,



Working Attorney
