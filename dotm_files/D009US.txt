Dear Contact Greeting:

This is a follow-up to our previous correspondence submitting a draft of the above-identified patent application for your review and comment. We note that we have not yet received your comments relating to this draft and ask that you contact us with instructions as to how you would like to proceed.

It is important to note that the ability to obtain a patent can be significantly affected by the passage of time. As you know, it is not possible to file a patent application on subject matter which has been publicly disclosed, or which has been sold or offered for sale, for more than a year. It is also possible that an application will be filed by others claiming the same subject matter, which could undermine your rights. The potential for loss of rights is even greater with respect to possible patent protection outside of the United States.

We therefore urge you to let us know at your earliest convenience if you wish to proceed further on this application. We look forward to receiving your instructions, which you may conveniently provide by checking the appropriate option on the enclosed form and returning to our office.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter further before deciding how to proceed. 

INSERT AFTER CLOSING:
		Yes, we would like to proceed with the patent application. We will contact you with our comments relating to the first draft.

	No, we do not wish to proceed with the patent application. Please close your file on this matter. 

	We have not decided whether to proceed with the patent application. Please follow up again in 	 months.
