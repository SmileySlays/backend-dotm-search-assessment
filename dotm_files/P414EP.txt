Dear Contact Greeting:

We are writing to inform you that a Supplementary Search Report, copy enclosed, has issued in connection with the above-identified patent application.  Due to the recent rule changes, it is now necessary to assess the relevance of any prior art and file a detailed response to the Search Report.  Please review the enclosed report and give us your comments and instructions.   

Because a Supplementary Search Report has been issued, we expect to receive in the near future a notice from the European Patent Office (EPO) that the applicant may withdraw the application and obtain a refund of the examination fee.  Please let us know if there is a possibility that this application will be abandoned, and we can determine if a refund would be available.

We will assume that you wish to proceed with examination of this case and will instruct the foreign associate to respond unless we hear from you to the contrary.  If you have any questions or would like to discuss this matter further, please do not hesitate to contact us. 

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
