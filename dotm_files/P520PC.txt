Dear Contact Greeting:

We have received an Invitation to Pay Additional Fees for the above-identified PCT application.  Copies of the Invitation, the original claims, and the cited references are enclosed.

The ISA considers there to be  distinct “groups” of inventions in the application, as follows:

1.	Claims 



Group 1 has been searched.  We can request a search of Group  for approximately $US.  The non-extendable deadline to make the request is .  We will not request a search of Group  unless you instruct otherwise before the deadline.

SUGGESTED ADDED PARAGRAPH:
If you are considering nationalizing this PCT application in Europe, a decision not to pay for a search of the additional claims will seriously restrict your options in the European phase.  The European Patent Office will require you to limit the European application to the one invention covered by the International Search Report, even if you do not consider it the most important aspect of your invention.  You will not have the opportunity during the European phase to pay additional search fees and have further searches carried out.  This will force the filing of divisional applications on any non-searched inventions, at considerable expense.

Although the International Search Report and Written Opinion have yet to issue, we provide the following summaries for your consideration.  

[This will affect EP filings--we should consider unity of invention rejections at the international level when quoting EP application costs?]

We will notify you when the ISR and WO are received.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to call us, particularly if you want to search Group .

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
