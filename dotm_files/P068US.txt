Dear Contact Greeting:

We recently filed the above-identified Provisional Patent Application.  The application was filed without small entity papers, and we therefore were required to pay the full filing fee charged to a large entity.  However, we understand that this case qualifies for the small entity category, and we therefore have enclosed a small entity declaration which needs to be executed and returned to us as soon as possible.

If the small entity declaration is executed and timely filed, a reduced fee of one half the normal fee will apply to the provisional application.  We can obtain a refund of the additional fee paid for this application if the declaration is filed within two months of the above-indicated filing date.  

Assuming that this document is accurate, we ask that you have it executed and returned to us as soon as possible, so that we may submit the refund request.  Please let us know if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further before proceeding.


Sincerely,



Working Attorney
