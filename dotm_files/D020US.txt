Dear Contact Greeting:

The filing of a patent application in the United States raises the requirement that the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) be advised of any known prior art which is believed to be material to the patentability of the claimed invention. The obligation to disclose prior art is a continuing duty throughout the prosecution of the patent application. Disclosure of prior art should be made within three months of receiving knowledge of the art, or at least prior to a first Office Action in the US application, in order to avoid a submission fee. 

Please advise if there is any known prior art which should be submitted to the USPTO. 

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
