Dear Sir/Madam:

We have placed this case with a renewals payment firm to pay the annuities.  While we appreciate the excellent service you provide, this decision is based simply on the need to better manage the number of annuities we must address each quarter. We request that your firm remain as the attorneys of record for the patent.

As a precautionary measure, please contact our firm immediately if you receive any notification from your Patent Office of a missed annuity payment.

Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions.

Sincerely,



First Name Last Name
