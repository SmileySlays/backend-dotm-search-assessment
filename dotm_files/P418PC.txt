Dear Contact Greeting:

	Enclosed is a list of the countries which were designated for the above-identified PCT application at the time of filing.  This list includes those countries (marked with an "*") which you specifically indicated were of interest.  In addition, we designated all other PCT member countries since there was no additional charge for these designations at the time of filing the PCT case.  This left open the option of proceeding also in one or more of these additional countries at the time that national applications were due.  

	It is now time to proceed with the national stage filings for this case.  We therefore ask that you indicate the countries in which you would now like to proceed with national stage filings by checking the appropriate lines and returning the list to us via fax or mail by .

	As always, if you have any comments or questions regarding this matter, do not hesitate to contact us. 

						Sincerely,



						Working Attorney
