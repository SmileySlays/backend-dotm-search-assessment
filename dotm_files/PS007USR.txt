Dear Contact Greeting:

This is a follow-up to our patentability search report letter concerning the above invention disclosure. We have not yet received instructions on whether an application should be prepared for this disclosure. 

We assume that this invention disclosure has not yet been reviewed at the Patent Committee Meeting-DC, so we will send another reminder letter in a couple of months. 

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter further before deciding how to proceed. We look forward to receiving your instructions. 

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
