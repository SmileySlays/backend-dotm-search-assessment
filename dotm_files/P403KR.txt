This application is considered to have an effective filing date of , which is the International Filing date of the corresponding PCT application upon which it is based.  However, the application claims priority from the counterpart US application, and therefore receives the benefit of the US filing date of .

This application will be laid open thirty (30) months after the first claimed priority filing date, i.e., the filing date of the counterpart US application.  Examination of the case will only occur upon the filing of a formal Request for Examination.  This Request must be submitted within five (5) years from the International Filing date.  Unless we hear to the contrary, we will simply wait until closer to that deadline before submitting a Request for Examination, and will request your authorization approximately six (6) months prior to the deadline.  In addition, a translation of the corresponding US application must be submitted to the KIPO, and we will confirm to you once that filing has been accomplished.

We will report further on this case as it progresses.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter further.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
