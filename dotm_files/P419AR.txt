Dear Name/DNC/Correspondence Address-Contact Greeting:

We are pleased to enclose the Letters Patent for the above-identified patent case in Argentina.  As mentioned in our previous letter, the term of the patent is fifteen years from the date of issue, therefore expiring on date.  While there is no requirement to mark, it is advisable to mark products made in accordance with the patent, as well as associated packaging and literature, with "Argentine Patent No. number”.  A consequence of not marking is that under certain circumstances a patentee may not be able to recover damages for infringement.

An annuity must be paid each year to maintain the patent in force until its expiration date. We will send a request for your instructions for payment as the date for the next annuity approaches. 

Please acknowledge receipt of the enclosed Letters Patent by signing below and returning a copy of this letter to us.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
 

Sincerely,



Case Data/Team Member/Working Attorney
 
[After the closing, add the following:]

☐	Receipt of the above Argentine Patent is acknowledged.
