Dear Contact Greeting:

I am writing this because about 8 months have passed since we filed the above provisional patent application with the US Patent and Trademark Office.  Accordingly, it is time to consider preparing and filing regular applications for this subject matter in the US and foreign countries where Ahlbrand wants to pursue protection since the one-year priority deadline is Date 551.  

	I understand that per Ahlbrand's standard practice, we will probably be filing a PCT application for the case along with a US utility case as a by-pass continuation at a later time after the international search report and written opinion are received.  I am writing now to confirm that instruction and to let you know that we plan to prepare the regular PCT application for filing unless we hear otherwise from you. We expect the PCT will include the same specification as the provisional case and we will work with the inventors to include any improvements or other possible changes that may be appropriate.  I am also copying  with this letter and will look for direction from them in preparing the regular PCT application as well.

So for now, we are proceeding per your standard instruction to prepare a draft of the PCT application for filing.  Please let me know if you have questions or if we should treat this case different in any way or if you have any other information or instructions to pass along.  Otherwise, we plan to go ahead as indicated and to have the PCT application ready for filing before the above deadline.

Best regards,


						Working Attorney
