Dear Name/DNC/Correspondence Address-Contact Greeting:

We are pleased to enclose the Letters Patent for the above-identified patent case in Korea.  The term of the patent is twenty years from the international filing date, therefore expiring on date.  While there is no requirement to mark, it is advisable to mark products made in accordance with the patent, as well as associated packaging and literature, with "Korean Patent No. number".  A consequence of not marking is that under certain circumstances a patentee may not be able to recover damages for infringement.

An annuity must be paid each year to maintain the patent in force until its expiration date.  Upon payment of the registration fee, we were also required to pay the annuities for the first three years.  Therefore, the next annuity will be due on date and  every year thereafter.  We will send a request for your instructions for payment as the date approaches.

Under current Korean Patent Law, the subject patent will be published in a forthcoming Patent Gazette, and an opposition may be filed within three (3) months of the publication date.

Please acknowledge receipt of the enclosed Patent Certificate by signing below and returning a copy of this letter to us.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. 

Sincerely,



Case Data/Team Member/Working Attorney

Enclosure

[After the closing, add the following:]

Receipt of the above-identified Korean Patent is acknowledged.
