Summary of the Law


A.	Claim Interpretation

Both infringement and invalidity analyses are two-step processes.  “The first [step] is determining the meaning and scope of the patent claims . . .” Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 979 (Fed. Cir. 1995), aff’d, 116 S. Ct. 1384 (1996).  When analyzing infringement, “The second step is comparing the properly construed claims to the device accused of infringing.”  Id.  Likewise, whether the specification supports the claims is determined in view of the properly construed claims, and the properly construed claims are compared to the prior art to determine whether they are valid.

There is no rigid algorithm for claim construction.  The Federal Circuit has stated that “we [have] recognized that there is no magic formula or catechism for conducting claim construction . . . [n]or is the court barred from considering any particular sources or required to analyze sources in any specific sequence, as long as those sources are not used to contradict claim meaning that is unambiguous in light of the intrinsic evidence.”  Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 75 U.S.P.Q.2d 1321, 1334-35 (Fed. Cir. 2005).  “[W]hat matters is for the court to attach the appropriate weight to be assigned to those sources in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent law.”  Id.

Under current case law, a term in a patent claim is given its ordinary meaning unless the patent’s claims, written description, drawings and/or the prosecution history suggest otherwise.  Desper Products, Inc. v. QSound Labs, Inc., 48 U.S.P.Q.2d 1088, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 1998).  “[T]he ordinary and customary meaning of a claim term is the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent application.”  Phillips, 75 U.S.P.Q.2d 1321, 1326.

Claim construction is a question of law.  See, e.g., Sinorgchem Co. Shandong v. Int’l Trade Comm’n, 511 F.3d 1132, 85 U.S.P.Q.2d 1415, 1418 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (citing Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., 138 F.3d 1448, 1456 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (en banc)).

1.	Intrinsic and Extrinsic Evidence

Generally, there are two main sources for determining the ordinary meaning of claim terms:  intrinsic evidence, found in the patent itself and its file history, and extrinsic evidence, which is found elsewhere.  Intrinsic evidence includes the claims of the patent, the patent’s specification, and prosecution history.  Primos Inc. v. Hutner’s Specialties Inc., 451 F.3d 841, 79 U.S.P.Q.2d 1129, 1134 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  A claim term’s meaning can also be determined from explicit or implicit usage in the patent’s specification.  Irdeto Access Inc. v. Echostar Satellite Corp., 383 F.3d 1295, 72 U.S.P.Q.2d 1678, 1682 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Bell Atlantic Network Svcs., Inc. v. Covad Comm. Group, 262 F.3d 1258, 1273 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  To that end, language used in the written description may limit a claim term or provide a disavowal of certain subject mater.  Honeywell Int’l Inc. v. ITT Indus. Inc., 79 U.S.P.Q.2d 1294 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  However, limitations cannot be read into the claims from the specification.  Id. at 1323.

The Federal Circuit has “also authorized district courts to rely on extrinsic evidence, which ‘consists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises.’”  Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303.  However, “a court may not use the accused product or process as a form of extrinsic evidence to supply limitations for patent claim language.” Wilson Sporting Goods Co. v. Hillerich & Bradsby Co., 442 F.3d 1322, 1330-1331, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 7169, *21-22, 78 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1382, 1389 (Fed. Cir. 2006). In Phillips, the Federal Circuit placed greater evidential weight or emphasis on intrinsic evidence when interpreting claims, and “viewed extrinsic evidence in general as less reliable than the patent and its prosecution history in determining how to read claim terms.”  Phillips, Id. at 1330.    Intrinsic evidence is also favored over extrinsic evidence because it is available to interested parties who seek to determine what the patent forbids them to do.  Id. See also MBO Labs. Inc. v. Becton, 474 F.3d 1323, 81 U.S.P.Q.2d 1661, 1665 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

2.	Means-Plus-Function Claims

Claim elements may be claimed in functional terms.  When expressed as a means or step for performing a specified function, such elements are means-plus-function or step-plus-function elements. 35 U.S.C. § 112(f) (pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. § 112 ¶6).  Proper construction of a potential means-plus-function claim is a three-step process.  First, it must be resolved whether the claim is, in fact, to be construed according to 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶6.  “Once a court concludes that a claim limitation is a means-plus-function limitation, two steps of claim construction remain: 1) the court must first identify the function of the limitation; and 2) the court must then look to the specification and identify the corresponding structure for that function.”  Biomedino LLC v. Waters Technologies Corp., 490 F.3d 946, 83 U.S.P.Q.2d 1118, 1121 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Use of the word “means for” or “step for” in claim language creates a presumption that 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶6 applies.  TriMed Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 514 F.3d 1256 (Fed. Cir. 2008); Greenberg v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., 91 F.3d 1580, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1996). If, in addition to the word “means” and the functional language, the claim recites sufficient structure for performing the described functions in their entirety, the presumption of 35 U.S.C. § 112 ¶ 6 is overcome—the limitation is not a means-plus-function or step-plus-function limitation.  TriMed Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 514 F.3d 1256 (Fed. Cir. 2008); Lighting World, Inc. v. Birchwood Lighting, Inc., 382 F.3d 1354, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Sufficient structure exists when the claim language specifies the exact structure that performs the function in question without need to resort to other portions of the specification or extrinsic evidence for an adequate understanding of the structure.  TriMed Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 514 F.3d 1256 (Fed. Cir. 2008); Altiris, Inc. v. Symantec Corp., 318 F.3d 1363, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

Conversely, the absence of the word “means” creates a presumption that 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶6 does not apply, which presumption can be overcome “if it is shown that the claim term fails to recite sufficiently definite structure or else recites function without reciting sufficient structure for performing the function.”  Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. v. Abacus Software, 462 F.3d 1344, 80 U.S.P.Q.2d 1225, 1231 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

If 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶6 does apply, the function is that which is “explicitly recited in the claim.”  See Micro Chem., Inc. v. Great Plains Chem. Co., 194 F.3d 1250, 1258 (Fed. Cir. 1999).

Finally, if 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶6 applies, the structure or structures corresponding to the function that is disclosed in the specification must be identified, because “[l]iteral infringement of a 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶6 limitation requires that the relevant structure in the accused device perform the identical function recited in the claim and be identical or equivalent” to that structure.  JVW Enterprises Inc. v. Interact Accessories Inc., 424 F.3d 1324; Odetics, Inc. v. Storage Tech. Corp., 185 F.3d 1259, 1267 (Fed. Cir. 1999).  If there is no structure in the specification corresponding to the means-plus-function limitation in the claims, the claim will be found invalid as indefinite.  See Atmel Corp. v. Info Storage Devices, Inc., 198 F.3d 1374, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing In re Donaldson, 16 F.3d at 1195).

The task of determining whether the relevant claim language contains a means-plus-function limitation is, as with all claim construction issues, a question of law that is reviewed de novo. Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs. Inc., 138 F.3d 1448, 1455-56 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (en banc).  A district court's identification of the function and corresponding structure of a means-plus-function limitation is also reviewed de novo.  ACTV, Inc. v. Walt Disney Co., 346 F.3d 1082, 1087 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

3.	Prosecution History Estoppel

Under the doctrine of prosecution history estoppel, patent claims may not be construed broadly enough to provide coverage that was given up during prosecution of the patent.  See Loctite Corp. v. Ultraseal Ltd., 781 F.2d 861, 870-71 (Fed. Cir. 1985).  There is “a broad range of activities that can give rise to prosecution history estoppel,” including but not limited to the amendment of a claim to overcome prior art rejections, or the submission of statements that characterize the meaning of the claim.  Haynes Int’l v. Jessop Steel Co., 8 F.3d 1573, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1993).  A disclaimer made with “‘reasonable clarity and deliberateness’” limits a claim, regardless of whether an examiner relied on or accepted them, because “[t]he public notice function of a patent and its prosecution history requires that a patentee be held to what he declares during the prosecution of his patent.”  Springs Window Fashions LP v. Novo Indus. LP, 65 U.S.P.Q.2d 1826, 1829-30 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (quoting Northern Telecom Ltd. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., 215 F.3d 1281, 1294 (Fed. Cir. 2000)).

In addition to informing the interpretation of the claims, it can restrict the application of the doctrine of equivalents.  Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 122 S.Ct. 1831 (2002).  The Supreme Court held that where a rationale for limiting the effect of prosecution history estoppel is not evident, it is presumed that the patentee surrendered all subject matter between the broader original claim language and the narrower amended language.  Id.  To overcome this presumption, a patentee may show “that the alleged equivalent could not reasonably have been described at the time the amendment was made, or that the alleged equivalent was tangential to the purpose of the amendment, or that the equivalent was not foreseeable (and thus not claimable) at the time of the amendment.”  Glaxo Wellcome, Inc. v. Impax Labs., Inc., 356 F.3d 1348, 1351-52 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (citing Festo VIII, 535 U.S. at 740-41).

B.	Invalidity 

In order for a patent to be infringed, the claims must be valid.  An issued United States patent is presumed to be valid.  35 U.S.C. § 282.  “The burden of establishing invalidity of a patent or any claim thereof shall rest on the party asserting such invalidity.”  Id.  Invalidity must therefore be demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence.  See Sitrick v. Dreamworks LLC, 85 U.S.P.Q.2d 1826, 1830 (Fed. Cir. 2008). However, in Patent Office proceedings, such as reexamination, invalidity facts are more easily established under the lower “preponderance of the evidence” standard and therefore would more likely be employed to challenge the validity of the patent, if necessary. Also, in either setting, legal questions (such as non-obviousness) are not subject to evidentiary standards. Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. P'ship (concurring opinion: “Many claims of invalidity rest, however, not upon factual disputes, but upon how the law applies to facts as given. Do the given facts show … that it was “non-obvious”? §§102, 103. …Where the ultimate question of patent validity turns on the correct answer to legal questions—what these subsidiary legal standards mean or how they apply to the facts as given—today’s strict standard of proof has no application.").     

Claims may be invalid either because the patent fails to meet the obligations necessary to support them, or because the patentee was never entitled to them in the first place in view of the existence of prior art.  These grounds are discussed in turn below.

1.	Indefiniteness

The patent statute requires that the scope of a patent be defined with claims, and that those claims must be definite:  “The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.” 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶2.  The requirement that the claims be definite renders a claim invalid when the meaning of a claim is ambiguous.  This is crucial to the proper functioning of the patent system, because otherwise patents do not provide potential infringers with fair notice of what the patent forbids.  See Halliburton Energy Services v. M-I LLC, 514 F.3d 1244 (Fed. Cir. 2008).  Permitting ambiguous claims gives patentees “unreasonable advantages.”  Athletic Alternatives, Inc. v. Prince Mfg., Inc., 73 F.3d 1573, 1581, 37 U.S.P.Q.2d 1365 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  “[T]he primary purpose of the [definiteness] requirement is ‘to guard against unreasonable advantages to the patentee and disadvantages to others arising from uncertainty as to their [respective] rights.’”  Id. (quoting Gen. Elec. Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp., 304 U.S. 364, 369 37 U.S.P.Q.2d 466 (1938)).  

“An analysis of claim indefiniteness under §112 ¶2 is inextricably intertwined with claim construction.” Atmel Corp. v. Information Storage Devices, Inc., 198 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (internal quotes omitted); see also Datamize v. Plumtree Software, Inc., 417 F.3d 1342, 1347-48 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (“By finding claims indefinite only if reasonable efforts at claim construction prove futile, we accord respect to the statutory presumption of validity and we protect the inventive contribution of patentees, even when the drafting of their patents has been less than ideal.”) (quoting Exxon Research & Eng'g Co. v United States, 265 F.3d at 1371, 1375 (Fed Cir 2001)); Oakley, Inc. v. Sunglass Hut Int'l, 316 F.3d 1331, 1340-41 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (determination of claim definiteness “requires a construction of the claims according to the familiar canons of claim construction”).  

“[T]he primary purpose of the requirement is ‘to guard against unreasonable advantages to the patentee and disadvantages to others arising from uncertainty as to their [respective] rights.’”  Id.  Thus, the “common thread” in cases where claims are found indefinite is that a person of ordinary skill in the art could not determine the bounds of the claims.  Id.; see also SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Apotex Corp., 403 F.3d 1331, 1404 (Fed. Cir. 2005).  However, claims are not indefinite merely because they present a difficult task of claim constructionnor even if “the conclusion is one over which reasonable persons will disagree.”  Id. (citing Exxon Research & Eng'g Co. v. United States, 265 F.3d 1371, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  Conversely, a claim is not necessarily definite just because one can articulate a definition that is supported by the specification.  Id.

Claims have been held indefinite for a variety of reasons.  They are indefinite for including a numeric limitation without specifying which of several different methods of measuring were to be used.  Honeywell Int'l, Inc. v. Int'l Trade Comm'n, 341 F.3d 1332, 1340 68 U.S.P.Q.2d 1023 (Fed. Cir. 2003)   And claims are indefinite when their meaning is dependent on context, so that the same product can infringe in some situations and not in others.  See Ex parte Brummer, 12 USPQ2d 1653 (TTAB 1989)(device parameters claimed in terms of the height of a user is indefinite since the user's height may vary).  

In deciding whether a claim is indefinite, it is proper to consider whether the claim “clearly differentiates itself from specific prior art.” Halliburton Energy Services v. M-I LLC, 514 F.3d 1244, 1252 (Fed. Cir. 2008).  “Such differentiation is an important consideration in the definiteness inquiry because in attempting to define a claim term, a person of ordinary skill is likely to conclude that the definition does not encompass that which is expressly distinguished as prior art.”  Id.  For example, a claim to a “fragile gel” was held indefinite because the intrinsic record argued that the graph of its viscosity (as a function of time and force applied within it) distinguished it from the prior art, but the court found that the graph did not distinguish the prior art.  The specification stated that a “fragile gel, as used herein” was one that “liquefies or becomes less gel-like under stress, such as caused by moving the fluid, but which quickly returns to a gel when the movement is stopped.”  Id.  The patent-holder argued that the term was defined by the “L-shaped” viscosity curve (shown in Figure 3 of the patent), which fell “directly back onto itself when force is applied.”  Id.  Noting that one class of prior art fluid (12.1 SF fluid) had this feature, the Federal Circuit held the claim indefinite.  

A claim term is particularly likely to be found indefinite when it is functional, rather than structuralthat is, when the term says “what it does rather than what it is.” Id. (quoting In re Swinehart, 439 F.2d 210, 212 (C.C.P.A. 1971).  The Supreme Court held that using functional language at the point of novelty is particularly egregious, and renders a claim invalid for indefiniteness.  General Electric v. Wabash Appliance Corp., 304 U.S. 364; Halliburton Energy Services v. M-I LLC, 514 F.3d 1244, 1255 (Fed. Cir. 2008).  In General Electric, the Supreme Court held that the claim for a filament “made up mainly of a number of comparatively large grains of such size and contour as to prevent substantial sagging and offsetting” was functional language at the point of novelty that rendered the claim invalid.  General Electric v. Wabash Appliance Corp., 304 U.S. 364 (1938).  The Court held that the use of the functional language was insufficient, and “if allowed would extend the monopoly beyond the invention.”  Id. at 371.  “[T]he vice of a functional claim exists not only when the claim is wholly functional, if that is ever true, but also when the inventor is painstaking when he recites what has already been seen, and then uses conveniently functional language at the exact point of novelty.  A limited use of terms of effect or result, which accurately define the essential qualities of a product to one skilled in the art, may in some instances be permissible and even desirable, but a characteristic essential to novelty may not be distinguished from the old art solely by its tendency to remedy the problems in the art met by the patent.”  Id. at 371-72.  

“The review of indefiniteness under 35 U.S.C. § 112, paragraph 2, proceeds as a question of law without deference.” AllVoice Computing PLC v. Nuance Commc’ns Inc., 84 U.S.P.Q.2d 1886, 1890 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (quoting SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Apotex Corp., 403 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2005)).

2.	Written Description

A patent specification must contain a “written description” of the claimed invention.  This requirement is set forth in 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶1, which begins by stating that the specification “shall contain a written description of the invention . . . .”  The Federal Circuit stated that “the description must ‘clearly allow persons of ordinary skill in the art to recognize that [the inventor] invented what is claimed.’” Ariad Pharms. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 598 F.3d 1336, 1351, 94 U.S.P.Q.2d 1161 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Like the enablement requirement (see Part B.3, below)but for different reasonsthe written description requirement imposes limits to the scope of a patent’s claims.  “[T]he test for sufficiency is whether the disclosure of the application relied upon reasonably conveys to those skilled in the art that the inventor had possession of the claimed subject matter as of the filing date.”  Id. at 1351 (citing Vas-Cath Inc. v. Mahurkar, 935 F.2d 1555, 1562-63 (Fed. Cir. 1991), citing In re Gosteli, 872 F.2d 1008, 1012 (Fed. Cir. 1989)).

Written description is a question of fact, based on the perspective of one of ordinary skill in the art as of the relevant filing date.  See Vas-Cath, Inc. v. Mahurkar, 935 F.2d 1555, 1563-64 [19 U.S.P.Q.2d 1111] (Fed. Cir. 1991); Falkner v. Inglis, 448 F.3d 1357, 79 U.S.P.Q.2d 1001, at 1005 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  “The invention is, for purposes of the ‘written description’ inquiry, whatever is now claimed.”  Vas-Cath, Inc. at 1563-64 (emphasis in original).  And “the written description requirement applies to all claims”, both original and amended.  Ariad Pharms. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 598 F.3d 1336, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

A claim is supported with a sufficient written description only if it is evident that the claim scope was in fact contemplated by the inventor at the time of filing.  Not having this requirement: “would lead to sweeping, overbroad claims because it would entitle an inventor to a claim scope far greater than what a person of skill in the art would understand the inventor to possess . . . .”  LizardTech, Inc. v. Earth Res. Mapping, Inc., 424 F.3d 1336, 1346, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 21434, *29, 76 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1724, 1732 (Fed. Cir. 2005).

	Obvious variants of an invention are not necessarily supported by the specification.  A description which renders obvious the claimed invention is not sufficient to satisfy the written description requirement of that invention.  Lockwood v. American Airlines, Inc., 107 F.3d 1565, 1572, 41 USPQ2d 1961, 1966 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  In other words, an applicant complies with the written description requirement “by describing the invention, with all its claimed limitations, not that which makes it obvious,” and by using “such descriptive means as words, structures, figures, diagrams, formulas, etc., that set forth the claimed invention.”  Id.

	Claim amendments are of particular interest, as is the case here.  Any introduction of new matter by way of amending the claims is strictly prohibited.  35 U.S.C. § 132.  Additionally, limitations added by the applicant during prosecution can give insight into what subject matter the applicant has given up.  Elkay Mfg. Co. v. Ebco Mfg. Co., 192 F.3d 973, 978 (Fed. Cir. 1999) citing Lemelson v. General Mills, Inc., 968 F.2d 1202, 1206, 23 USPQ2d 1284, 1288 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (“The prosecution history gives insight into what the applicant originally claimed as the invention, and often what the applicant gave up in order to meet the Examiner’s objections.”); see also Standard Oil Co. v. American Cynamid Co., 774 F.2d 448, 452, 227 USPQ 293, 296 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (“[T]he prosecution history (or file wrapper) limits the interpretation of claims so as to exclude any interpretation that may have been disclaimed or disavowed during prosecution in order to obtain claim allowance.”).  Prosecution history also can limit or preclude the availability of the doctrine of equivalents. Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki CO., 535 US 722, 733-34 (2002) (“Prosecution history estoppel requires that the claims of a patent be interpreted in light of the proceedings in the PTO during the application process. . . . While the patentee has the right to appeal, his decision to forgo an appeal and submit an amended claim is taken as a concession that the invention as patented does not reach as far as the original claim. ” Therefore, limitations added to the claims during the prosecution of a patent are of significant importance in determining claim scope.


3.	Enablement

The enablement requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph, requires that the specification describe “the manner and process of making and using [the invention], in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the [invention].”  The Federal Circuit clarified in Ariad Pharms. v. Eli Lilly & Co. that § 112 ¶ 1 contains an enablement requirement separate from the written description requirement. 598 F.3d 1336, 1351, 94 U.S.P.Q.2d 1161 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  

[This] requirement to describe one’s invention is basic to patent law.  Every patent must describe an invention.  It is part of the quid pro quo of a patent; one describes an invention, and, if the law’s other requirements are met, one obtains a patent. The specification must then, of course, describe how to make and use the invention (i.e., enable it). . . .

Id. at 1345.

 “[T]he enablement requirement is satisfied when one skilled in the art, after reading the specification, could practice the claimed invention without undue experimentation.’”  AK Steel Corp. v. Sollac, 344 F.3d 1234, 1244 (Fed. Cir. 2003); accord Minerals Separation v. Hyde, 242 U.S. 261, 270 (1916); see also In re Wands, 858 F.2d 731, 736-37, 8 U.S.P.Q.2d 1400, 1404 (Fed. Cir. 1988).  Thus, the test of enablement is not whether any experimentation is necessary, but whether, if experimentation is necessary, it is undue.  In re Angstadt, 537 F.2d 498, 504, 190 U.S.P.Q. 214, 219 (CCPA 1976)

To be valid, the full scope of the claim must be enabled.  See Sitrick v. Dreamworks LLC, 85 U.S.P.Q.2d 1826, 1830 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (citing Auto. Techs. Int’l, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., 501 F.3d 1274, 1825 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Enablement is a question of law based on underlying factual findings.  In re Vaeck, 947 F.2d 488, 495, 20 U.S.P.Q.2d 1438, 1444 (Fed. Cir. 1991); Atlas Powder Co. v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 750 F.2d 1569, 1576, 224 U.S.P.Q. 409, 413 (Fed. Cir. 1984).  

4.	Best Mode

As part of the enactment of the Leahy Smith America Invents Act (“AIA”), failure to disclose the “best mode” in a patent application can no longer be used in a civil litigation as a ground to invalidate a patent. This defense was eliminated upon the enactment of the AIA and applies to all proceedings commenced on or after September 16, 2011. The AIA, however, did not remove the requirement of disclosing the best mode from 35 U.S.C. § 112.  Nor did the AIA explicitly exclude an inequitable conduct defense based on an intentional concealment of the best mode. Therefore, the best mode may still be relevant in infringement defense. 


5.	Prior Art

Claims are invalid if they are either anticipated or obvious in view of the prior art.  35 U.S.C. §§ 102, 103.  If all of the elements of a claim are found in a single reference, then the claim is invalid as being “anticipated” by the prior art reference.  In re Paulsen, 30 F.3d 1475, 1479, 31 U.S.P.Q.2d 1671, 1673 (Fed. Cir. 1994).  If a claim is an obvious variation of a prior reference, or an obvious combination of elements found in prior references, it is invalid under § 103.  KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 127 S.Ct. 1727, 82 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385 (2007).

A reference is considered to disclose the subject matter that is either expressly or inherently disclosed in that document.  Atlas Powder Co. v. Ireco Inc., 190 F.3d 1342, 1347, 51 U.S.P.Q.2d 1943, 1947 (Fed. Cir. 1999).  Further, “[m]aterial not explicitly contained in the single, prior art document may still be considered for purposes of anticipation if that material is incorporated by reference into the document.”  Ultradent Prods., Inc. v. Life-Like Cosmetics, Inc., 127 F.3d 1065, 1069, 44 U.S.P.Q.2d 1336, 1339-1340 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  It is sufficient if the host document identifies what specific material it incorporates and clearly indicates where that material is found in the incorporated document.  Advanced Display Sys., Inc. v. Kent State Univ., 54 U.S.P.Q.2d 1673, 1679 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

Establishing invalidity may be more difficult if reliance is placed solely upon prior art that was known to the Patent Office prior to issuing the patent.  Ultra-Tex Surfaces Inc. v. Hill Bros. Chem. Co., 204 F.3d 1360, 53 U.S.P.Q.2d 1892, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); see also Aktiebolaget Karlstads Mekaniska Werkstad v. United States Int’l Trade Comm’n, 217 U.S.P.Q. 865, 873-74 (Fed. Cir. 1983).  However, a patent can nevertheless be shown to be invalid over cited art if it is apparent that such art defeats novelty or shows the claimed invention to be obvious.  PharmaStem Therapeutics, Inc. v. ViaCell Inc., 491 F.3d 1342, 83 U.S.P.Q.2d 1289 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The deference that might otherwise be given to the examination by the Patent Office can be offset by circumstances indicating less than a full and accurate review of the patent.  This may result, for example, where an examiner failed to fully understand or appreciate the content or relevance of the prior art of record.  This may occur under various circumstances, such as if the patent applicant misrepresented the prior art or failed to meaningfully disclose the content or relevance of such art.

a.	Anticipation

A claim is invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 102 if it can be established by clear and convincing evidence that the claim lacks novelty or is anticipated.  The standard for anticipation is one of strict identity.  To anticipate a claim for a patent, a single prior art source must contain all its essential elements.  Rockwell Int’l Corp. v. United States, 147 F.3d 1358, 1363, 47 U.S.P.Q. 2d 1027, 1031 (Fed. Cir. 1998)  “Anticipation under 35 U.S.C. Section 102 requires the disclosure in a single piece of prior art of each and every limitation of a claimed invention.  In other words, to sustain an assertion of invalidity due to anticipation requires that a single prior art reference disclose all elements of the claimed invention.  Standard Havens Prod. Inc. v. Gencor Indus., Inc., 21 U.S.P.Q.2d 1321, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1991).

Whether such art is anticipatory is a question of fact.  Electro Med. Sys. S.A. v. Cooper Life Sciences, 34 F.3d 1048, 1052, 32 U.S.P.Q. 2d 1017, 1019 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

b.	Obviousness

A claim may be invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as obvious in view of one or more prior references.  As with other attacks on validity, “[i]nvalidity based on obviousness of a duly issued patent must be established by clear and convincing evidence.”  Glaverbel Societe Anonyme v. Northlake Mktg., 45 F.3d 1550, 1555 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (citing Polaroid Corp. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 789 F.2d 1556, 1558, 229 U.S.P.Q. 561, 562-63 (Fed. Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 850, 107 S.Ct. 178, 93 L.Ed. 2d 114 (1986)).

The starting point in any obviousness analysis is the Supreme Court’s holding in Graham et al. v. John Deere Co., 148 U.S.P.Q. 459, 467 (U.S. 1966), stating:

Under § 103, the scope and content of the prior art are to be determined; differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained; and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved.  Against this background, the obviousness or nonobviousness of the subject matter is determined.

Obviousness is determined in the context of a person of ordinary skill in the art, at the time the invention was made.  KSR, at 1388.  “Factors that may be considered in determining level of ordinary skill in the art include: (1) the educational level of the inventor; (2) type of problems encountered in the art; (3) prior art solutions to those problems; (4) rapidity with which innovations are made; (5) sophistication of the technology; and (6) educational level of active workers in the field.  Not all such factors may be present in every case, and one or more of these or other factors may predominate in a particular case.”  Environmental Designs Ltd. et al. v. Union Oil Co. of Cal. et al., 218 U.S.P.Q. 865, 868 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (internal citations omitted).

The Federal Circuit has also stated that, “[i]n determining obviousness, the invention must be considered as a whole without the benefit of hindsight, and the claims must be considered in their entirety.”  Rockwell Int’l Corp. v. United States, 147 F.3d 1358, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 1998) citing to W.L. Gore & Assocs., v. Garlock, Inc., 721 F.2d 1540, 1551-53 (Fed. Cir. 1983).

Moreover, the Supreme Court has held that one must consider so-called “secondary considerations” to help inform an obviousness analysis.  KSR; Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 148 U.S.P.Q. 459 (1966).  Such secondary considerations include:  commercial success, long felt but unsolved needs, failure of others.  Id.  They also include “teaching away”, In re Sullivan, 498 F.3d 1345, widespread adoption, or recognition of the patentee’s work, PharmaStem Therapeutics Inc. v. ViaCell Inc., 491 F.3d 1342, 83 U.S.P.Q.2d 1289, and contemporaneous invention, Monarch Knitting Mach. Corp. v. Sulzer Morat GmbH, 139 F.3d 877, 45 U.S.P.Q.2d 1977, 1983 (Fed. Cir. 1998).  The list of secondary considerations is not closed; any kind of circumstantial evidence (or “objective considerations”) that suggests whether an invention was obvious should be considered as part of an obviousness analysis.

A factor that is often at issue is “commercial success.”  In order to establish non-obviousness through commercial success, it must be shown both that (1) the commercial product is a financial success, and (2) there is a causal nexus between the claimed invention and the commercial success i.e., the commercial success was due to the claimed features.  Ormco Corp. v. Align Tech. Inc., 463 F.3d 1299, 79 U.S.P.Q.2d 1931 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

The Supreme Court has given legal principles from its decision in KSR v. Teleflex to guide an obviousness determination:

	•	Section 103 forbids issuance of a patent when “the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.”

	•	The combination of familiar elements according to known methods is likely to be obvious when it does no more than yield predictable results.

	•	In Anderson’s-Black Rock, Inc. v. Pavement Salvage Co., 396 U. S. 57 (1969) … the subject matter of the patent before the Court was a device combining two pre-existing elements: a radiant-heat burner and a paving machine. The device, the Court concluded, did not create some new synergy: The radiant-heat burner functioned just as a burner was expected to function; and the paving machine did the same. The two in combination did no more than they would in separate, sequential operation. Id., at 60–62. In those circumstances, “while the combination of old elements performed a useful function, it added nothing to the nature and quality of the radiant-heat burner already patented,” and the patent failed under §103.

	•	If a technique has been used to improve one device, and a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that it would improve similar devices in the same way, using the technique is obvious unless its actual application is beyond his or her skill.  

	•	If the claim extends to what is obvious, it is invalid under §103.  One of the ways in which a patent’s subject matter can be proved obvious is by noting that there existed at the time of invention a known problem for which there was an obvious solution encompassed by the patent’s claims.  

	•	Under the correct analysis, any need or problem known in the field of endeavor at the time of invention and addressed by the patent can provide a reason for combining the elements in the manner claimed.

	•	When there is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified, predictable solutions, a person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp. If this leads to the anticipated success, it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense. In that instance the fact that a combination was obvious to try might show that it was obvious under §103.

	•	Rigid preventative rules that deny factfinders recourse to common sense, however, are neither necessary under our case law nor consistent with it.

KSR (underlining added).  

It bears noting that, in 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court revisited the question of patent invalidity and reaffirmed that invalidity must be proven by a challenger by “clear and convincing evidence” on factual questions.  Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. P'ship, 131 S. Ct. 2238, 2242 (U.S. 2011).  This is higher than a normal litigation burden of proof of “a preponderance of the evidence”.  However, it is important not to read Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. P'ship too far.  Specifically, “obviousness”  is a legal question—not a factual question, albeit based on several subordinate factual questions.  As the concurring opinion in Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. P'ship points out, the "clear and convincing" evidentiary standard only applies to genuinely disputed factual issues, not to the legal determination of obviousness.  "Many claims of invalidity rest, however, not upon factual disputes, but upon how the law applies to facts as given. Do the given facts show … that it was “non-obvious”? §§102, 103. …Where the ultimate question of patent validity turns on the correct answer to legal questions—what these subsidiary legal standards mean or how they apply to the facts as given—today’s strict standard of proof has no application."  Id.     


6.	Patentee’s Conduct

Even if a patentee was originally entitled to a given claim, and if the specification adequately supports that claim, it may still be rendered invalid or unenforceable due to the conduct of the patentee.  A patent may be rendered unenforceable due to inequitable conduct before the Patent and Trademark Office during prosecution of the application or through misuse of the patent after issue.

a.	Inequitable Conduct

			i. Prior Art

“Inequitable conduct is an equitable defense to patent infringement that, if proved, bars enforcement of a patent.”  Therasense, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson & Co., 649 F.3d 1276, 1285 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Raising the defense of inequitable conduct requires the defendant to prove by clear and convincing evidence both intent to deceive the USPTO and materiality.  “To prevail on the defense of inequitable conduct, the accused infringer must prove that the applicant misrepresented or omitted material information with the specific intent to deceive the PTO.”  Id.  If the defendant meets this burden of proof, “the district court must weight the equities to determine whether the applicant’s conduct before the PTO warrants rendering the entire patent unenforceable.”  Id.

To prove the intent to deceive the PTO, “the accused infringer must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant knew of the reference, knew that it was material, and made a deliberate decision to withhold it.”  Id.  The courts have recognized that “direct” evidence is rarely, if ever, available since few inventors will openly confess an intent to deceive.  So, the Federal Circuit allows intent to be inferred from indirect and circumstantial evidence, but it must be “the single most reasonable inference able to be drawn from the evidence.”  Id. (citing Star Scientific Inc. v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 537 F.3d 1357, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2008)).  “[A] district court may not infer intent solely from materiality,” and “[t]he absence of a good faith explanation for withholding a material reference does not, by itself, prove intent to deceive.”  Id.  Similarly, “[a] district court should not use a ‘sliding scale,’ where a weak showing of intent may be found sufficient based on a strong showing of materiality, and vice versa.

To prove materiality, the accused infringer must show by clear and convincing evidence that the USPTO would not have allowed a claim had it been aware of the undisclosed prior art.  Prior art may satisfy this “but-for” materiality requirement “if it would have blocked patent issuance under the PTO’s different evidentiary standards,” even if a district court does not invalidate a claim based on the reference.  Id.  In cases of “egregious misconduct” such as filing an unmistakably false affidavit or other “deliberately planned and carefully executed scheme[s]”, the misconduct is material.  Id.

Patent Office procedures require an inventor, his patent attorney, and all persons substantively involved in the patent application to disclose material information to the patent examiner.  Since the patent process is nonadversarial, the law imposes this duty of candor to provide the examiner with all material information so as to avoid the Patent Office issuing patents with a lack of information.  Moreover, the Manual for Patent Examining Procedure notes that “foreign patent attorneys representing  applicants for U.S. patents through local correspondent firms surely must be held to the same standards of conduct which apply to their American counterparts; a double standard of accountability would allow foreign attorneys and their clients to escape responsibility for fraud or inequitable conduct merely by withholding from the local correspondent information unfavorable to patentability and claiming ignorance of the United States disclosure requirements.”  MPEP § 2004, citing Gemveto Jewelry Co. v. Lambert Bros., Inc., 542 F.Supp. 933, 943 (S.D.N.Y. 1992).

	i. Best Mode
	
As mentioned above, failure to disclose the “best mode” in a patent application can no longer be used in a civil litigation as a ground to invalidate a patent, but the AIA did not explicitly exclude an inequitable conduct defense based on an intentional concealment of the best mode. Therefore, the best mode may still be relevant in infringement defense. 

A patent specification must “set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.”  35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶1.  “The purpose of the best mode requirement is to restrain inventors from applying for patents while at the same time concealing from the public preferred embodiments of the inventions they have in fact conceived.”  Teleflex, Inc. v. Ficosa N. Am. Corp., 299 F.3d 1313, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2002).

“To apply the best mode standard, a court must first determine whether, at the time the patent application was filed, the inventor had a best mode of practicing the claimed invention.  This determination turns on the inventor's own subjective beliefs.  The second part of the analysis asks has the inventor ‘concealed’ his preferred mode from the ‘public’?”  AllVoice Computing PLC v. Nuance Commc’ns Inc., 84 U.S.P.Q.2d 1886, 1894 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (internal citations omitted).

Only the claimed invention is subject to the best mode requirement.  DeGeorge v. Bernier, 768 F.2d 1318, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 1985).  Consequently, it is never a violation of the best mode requirement to fail to disclose an unclaimed device or process, even if the applicant did believe it superior to the claimed invention.  See Allvoice, at 1895.


b.	Misuse

Patent misuse is a judge-made doctrine that is in derogation of statutory patent rights against infringement. Princo Corp. v. ITC, 616 F.3d 1318, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2010). The “policy of the patent misuse doctrine is ‘to prevent a patentee from using the patent to obtain market benefit beyond that which inures in the statutory patent right.’”  Monsanto Co. v. McFarling, 363 F.3d 1336, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  In order for competitive behavior to amount to patent misuse, one must “impermissibly broaden the scope of the patent grant with anticompetitive effect.”  Id.  Thus, “[i]n the cases in which the restriction is reasonably within the patent grant, the patent misuse defense can never succeed.”  Id.  

Even if an alleged infringer is not harmed by the abusive practice, courts will withhold remedy for infringement or breach of a license agreement if patent misuse is found. The rights of the patents owner, however, will be restored if and when the misuse is purged, such as upon abandonment of the abusive practice and after dissipation of any harmful consequences. Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., 314 U.S. 488, 493, 62 S. Ct. 402, 405, (U.S. 1942).

Classic acts of misuse include (1) tying arrangements that include royalties on unpatented components or on total sales, (2) requiring the purchase of unpatented goods for use with the patented apparatus or processes, (3) prohibiting production or sale of competing goods, (4) conditioning the granting of a license under one patent upon the acceptance of another and different license (i.e., “package licensing”), (5) price fixing (which is also a per se violation of antitrust laws), and (6) royalties and restraints after expiration of the patent. Patent misuse may be found even where there is no antitrust violation, because “[p]atent misuse is … a broader wrong than [an] antitrust violation.”  C.R. Bard, Inc. v. M3 Sys., Inc., 157 F.3d 1340, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 1998).

A patent owner, however, may refuse either to issue licenses or to make or sell the claimed invention. “No patent owner otherwise entitled to relief. . . shall be denied relief or deemed guilty of misuse or illegal extension of the patent right by reason of his having . . . refused to license or use any rights to the patent … .”  35 U.S.C. § 271(d).  

c.	Assignor Estoppel

Unlike other kinds of conduct on the part of a patentee, which can operate to render otherwise valid claims invalid or unenforceable, assignor estoppel operates to bar validity attacks.  Assigning a patent or an invention and patent application for value “estops the assignor from later contending that the assigned property was valueless.”  Q.G. Products Inc. v. Shorty Inc., 992 F.2d 1211, 26 U.S.P.Q.2d 1778, 1280 (Fed. Cir. 1993).  An assignor of a patent “may submit evidence to help properly construe or narrow the claims of the assigned patent,” but is “estopped to challenge their validity.”  Id. (citing Westinghouse Elec. & Mfg. v. Formica Insulation Co., 266 U.S. 342, 351 (1924)).  However, the scope of the estoppel is more difficult to determine, and generally more narrow, when the assignment occurs before the patent issues.  Westinghouse Elec. & Mfg. v. Formica Insulation Co., 266 U.S. 342, at 252-53.



C.	Infringement

A device or process infringes a patent if it is covered by at least one of its claims.  As discussed above, an infringement analysis is a two-step process.  “The first [step] is determining the meaning and scope of the patent claims asserted to be infringed . . . .  The second step is comparing the properly construed claims to the device accused of infringing.”  Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 979 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en banc).  Infringement is a question of fact, and the patent owner bears the burden of proving infringement based on a preponderance of the evidence

Infringement of a patent can occur either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.  Infringement can also be either direct under 35 U.S.C. § 271 (a) or indirect under §§ 271(b) or (c).

1.	Literal Infringement

To literally infringe a patent claim, each and every element of the claim must be present in the accused device.  Johnson v. IVAC Corp., 885 F.2d 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1989).  Where the compared device does not possess each and every limitation in at least one of the patent claims, as properly construed, then the patent is not literally infringed.  Markman, 52 F.3d 967, 976.

2.	Infringement Under the Doctrine of Equivalents

Even if literal infringement is not found, a patent claim can still be infringed under the doctrine of equivalents.  Infringement under the doctrine of equivalents requires that an accused device meet each element in a claim either literally or by equivalency.  Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., 339 U.S. 605, 608 (1950).  For this purpose, “[e]ach element contained in a patent claim is deemed material to defining the scope of the patented invention, and thus the doctrine of equivalents must be applied to the individual elements of the claim, not to the invention as a whole.”  Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co., 137 L.Ed.2d 146, 161, 41 U.S.P.Q. 2d 1865, 1871 (1997).

The primary test for equivalency is the “function-way-result” or “triple identity” test, whereby the patentee may show an equivalent when the accused product or process performs substantially the same function, in substantially the same way, to achieve substantially the same result, as disclosed in the claim.  Graver Tank & Mfg. Co.. v. Linde Air Prods. Co., 339 U.S. 605, 608, 70 S.Ct. 854, 94 L.Ed. 1097 (1950)).  But, because “[d]ifferent linguistic frameworks may be more suitable to different cases,” Warner-Jenkinson, 520 U.S. at 40, 117 S.Ct. 1040, the function-way-result test is not the only test for equivalency.  Equivalency may also be proven where the differences between the invention as claimed and the accused product or process are insubstantial. 

Abbott Labs., v. Sandoz, Inc., 566 F.3d 1282, 1296-97 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  

Infringement under the doctrine of equivalents requires that an accused device meet each element in a claim either literally or by equivalency.  Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., 339 U.S. 605, 608 (1950).  The normal inquiry under the doctrine of equivalents is whether a substitute element in the accused device performs the same function, in the same way, to achieve the same result as the claimed element.  Graver Tank, supra.  An alternative inquiry is whether the substitute element plays a role substantially different from the claimed element.  Graver Tank, supra, at 168.

The doctrine of equivalents does not allow for the elimination of “meaningful structural and functional limitations of the claim on which the public is entitled to rely in avoiding infringement.”  Conopco, Inc. v. May Dep’t Stores Co., 46 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1994), cert denied, 115 S.Ct. 1724 (1995).  If the accused product does not possess a substitute structure that performs the same function, in the same way, to achieve the same result, then the claim is not infringed under the doctrine of equivalents. Similarly, “ ‘when a patent drafter discloses but declines to claim subject matter … this action dedicates that unclaimed subject matter to the public.’ ” Johnson & Johnston Assocs. v. R.E. Serv. Co., 285 F.3d 1046, 1054 (Fed. Cir. 2002), citing Maxwell v. J. Baker, Inc., 86 F.3d 1098, 1106 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

The prior art also limits the range of equivalents to which a patent is entitled.  “[T]he doctrine of equivalents cannot be used to expand claim scope to encompass the prior art.”  Hyperphrase Techs., LLC v. Google, Inc.,  260 Fed. Appx. 274, 282, 87 U.S.P.Q.2d 1285 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Wilson Sporting Goods Co. v. David Geoffrey & Assocs., 904 F.2d 677, 685 (Fed. Cir. 1990).  The patent owner bears the burden of proving that any proposed claim scope under the doctrine of equivalents does not read on the prior art.  DePuy Spine, Inc. v. Medtronic Sofamor Donetsk, Inc., 567 F.3d 1314, 1323-24, 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1865 (Fed. Cir. 1009) (citing Wilson Sporting Goods Co. v. David Geoffrey & Assocs., 904 F.2d 677, 685 (Fed. Cir. 1990)).  See also, Streamfeeder, LLC v. Sure-Feed Sys., Inc., 175 F.3d 974, 983 (Fed. Cir. 1999).

Additionally, although rare, some court decisions recognize a “reverse” doctrine of equivalents in which an accused product or process that falls within the literal scope of a claim nevertheless does not infringe the claimed product or process if it “is so far changed in principle . . . that it performs the same or a similar function in a substantially different way.” Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Prods. Co., 339 U.S. 605, 608-609 (1950).

3.	Indirect Infringement

Even in the absence of direct infringement by a particular party, that party may infringe a patent by being a contributory infringer or by actively inducing another to infringe.  35 U.S.C. §§ 271 (b), (c).

“Liability for either active inducement of infringement or for contributory infringement is dependent upon the existence of direct infringement,” that is, there can be no indirect infringement against one party unless some other party is guilty of direct infringement.  AquaTex Indus. Inc. v. Techniche Solutions, 419 F.3d 1374, 76 U.S.P.Q.2d 1213, 1217 (Fed. Cir. 2005).   See also Limelight Networks, Inc. v. Akamai Techs. Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2111, 2113 (U.S. 2014). Consequently, indirect infringement is primarily significant because it permits the patentee to “enforce his rights against the competitor who brought about the infringement, rather than requiring the patentee to undertake the almost insuperable task of finding and suing all the innocent purchasers.”  Dawson Chem. Co. v. Rohm and Hass Co., 448 U.S. 176 (1980).

a.	Inducing Infringement

The patent statute provides that “[w]homever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.”  35 U.S.C. § 271 (b).  Section 271(b) appears to have two parts: (1) knowledge that the induced act constitutes infringement, and (2) knowledge of the existence of the patent being infringed.  In Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A., 131 S. Ct. 2060 (2011), the Supreme Court held that “[i]nduced infringement under §271(b) requires knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent infringement.” The Court stated that the knowledge for liability under §271(b) is the same as that under §271(c).  In short, “§271(b) requires knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent infringement.”  Id. at 2068.  Additionally, §271(b) requires “knowledge of the existence of the patent that is infringed.”  Id. at 2068.

In Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A., 131 S. Ct. 2060 (2011), the Supreme Court used willful blindness to satisfy the knowledge required by §271(b).  Id. at 2069.  The Court stated that there are two basic requirements for willful blindness: “(1) the defendant must subjectively believe that there is a high probability that a fact exists and (2) the defendant must take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact.”  Id. at 2070.  “Under this formulation, a willfully blind defendant is one who takes deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high probability of wrongdoing and who can almost be said to have actually known the critical facts.”  Id. at 2070-71.  Mere knowledge of a “known risk” that the induced acts are infringing is insufficient.  See id.  Additionally, only a “deliberate indifference” to that risk is insufficient.  See id.

Negligence is clearly not enough for infringement under §271(b).  The Court in Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A., 131 S. Ct. 2060 (2011) distinguished willful blindness from recklessness and negligence.  “A reckless defendant is one who merely knows of a substantial and unjustified risk of such wrongdoing, and a negligent defendant is one who should have known of a similar risk but, in fact, did not.”  Id. at 2071.  While the Court found the evidence in this case to be sufficient under the correct standard to affirm the ruling in favor of SEB, it rejected the Federal Circuit’s test that §271(b) requires a showing that the alleged infringer “knew or should have known that his actions would induce actual infringements.”  Id. at 2065.  Furthermore, negligence is implicitly insufficient for §271(b) given the Court’s holding that a “deliberate indifference to a known risk that a patent exists does not satisfy the knowledge required by §271(b).”  It is less clear whether recklessness would be sufficient for infringement under §271(b).  

b.	Contributory Infringement

Contributory infringement exists “to protect patent rights from subversion by those who, without directly infringing the patent themselves, engage in acts designed to facilitate infringement by others.  Dawson Chem. Co. v. Rohm and Hass Co., 448 U.S. 176 (1980).  Contributory infringement exists where the party knows the apparatus to be “especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement,” unless the apparatus has a “substantial noninfringing use.”  35 U.S.C. § 271 (c); see BMC Resources Inc. v. Paymentech LP, 498 F.3d 1373, 84 U.S.P.Q.2d 1545, 1550 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Whether something is a “staple article or commodity of commerce” is a separate question from whether it has a substantial noninfringing use.  See AquaTex Indus. Inc. v. Techniche Solutions, 419 F.3d 1374, 76 U.S.P.Q.2d 1213, 1217 (Fed. Cir. 2005).  In practice, though, most contributory infringement cases turn on whether there is a “substantial” noninfringing use for the accused product, rather than whether the product is a staple article.  See, e.g., id.

Whether a product has a substantial noninfringing use is a fact sensitive inquiry, and courts have considered a wide variety of factors in deciding it.  Perhaps the most important single factor is the proportion of sales that is for infringing use.  If the noninfringing use is occasional or aberrant, it is probably not substantial.  See Hoffmann-La Roland Inc. v. Promega Corp, 33 U.S.P.Q.2d 1641 (N.D. Calif. 1994); EWP Corp. v. Reliance Universal Inc., 221 U.S.P.Q. 542 (S.D Ohio 1983) rev’d on other grounds; Dennison Mfg. v. Ben Clements & Sons, 203 U.S.P.Q. 895, 925 (S.D.N.Y 1979).  Similarly, the likelihood and frequency of the infringing use may be considered.  See Hoffman, supra.  Qualitative factors also weigh in the calculation.  If the noninfringing use is inefficient or uneconomical, Mendenhall v. Astec Indus., 13 U.S.P.Q.2d 1913 (E.D. Tenn. 1988); Bliss and Laughlin Indus. v. Bil-Jax, Inc., 176 U.S.P.Q. 119 (N.D. Ohio 1972), or is not commercially viable, Hoffman, it is most likely not “substantial.”  A fortiori, if the only commercial use of the product infringes, it will be found not to have a substantial noninfringing use.  Rohm & Haas Co. v. Owen-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 196 U.S.P.Q. 726 (N.D. Ala. 1977).

4.	Method Claims

There is no statutory authority to accuse an apparatus manufacturer of direct infringement of a patented process that the apparatus performs, under 35 U.S.C. 271(a).  In addition, the courts have made abundantly clear that such is improper by stating in Joy Technologies, Inc. v. Flakt, Inc., 6 F.3d 770, 774-75 (Fed. Cir. 1993): 

A method claim is not directly infringed by the sale of an apparatus even though it is capable of performing only the patented method.  The sale of the apparatus is not a sale of the method.  A method claim is directly infringed only by one practicing the patented method.

Nevertheless, a party may indirectly infringe a method claim through the sale of an apparatus.  Id.; see also Part C.3, above.

5.	Dependent Claims

If the independent claims in a patent have been specifically analyzed and found not to be infringed, claims dependent upon these claims are also not infringed.  “It is axiomatic that dependent claims cannot be found infringed unless the claims from which they depend have been found to have been infringed.”  Wahpeton Canvas Co. v. Frontier, Inc., 870 F.2d 1546, 1553 & n.9 (Fed. Cir. 1989).  Thus, where an independent claim is found not to be infringed, no further review of claims dependent on that independent claim is necessary.
