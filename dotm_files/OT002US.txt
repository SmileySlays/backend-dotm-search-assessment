NOTICE OF OPPOSITION

	In the matter of an Application for Trademark Registration of mark for (goods/services) Serial No. number filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Filing Date by Applicant of City and State of Applicant (hereinafter "Applicant") which Application was published on page number in the Official Gazette on Date; Opposer (hereinafter "Opposer"), Opposer's address believes it will be damaged by registration of the mark of such Application and hereby opposes its federal registration.
	The grounds for the Opposition are as follows:
	1.  From a date long prior to the date of first use in commerce by Applicant of the mark Opposer has been engaged in the business of, among other things, describe and has identified its said products as mark products, and Opposer's use of said mark to identify such products has been continuous and uninterrupted.
	2.  Opposer has expended substantial sums of money as well as considerable time and effort in promoting and popularizing its mark, and Opposer continues to do so.  As a result, Opposer's mark has become well and favorably known to the purchasing public.  Because of the excellence and high quality of its products so identified, and because of the extensive use and advertising of the mark, the public has come to associate the mark with Opposer.
	3.  The mark for which Applicant seeks registration is confusingly similar to Opposer's mark, and the respective products are identical.
	4.  The registration by Applicant of the mark sought to be registered should be denied.  If Applicant succeeds in registering its mark, there will be statutory rights created thereby in violation of the earlier established rights of Opposer, all to the harm of Opposer's goodwill and with the resultant diminution of Opposer's rights in its mark, all to the damage and injury of Opposer and of the public.
	5.  The use of the mark sought to be registered by Applicant is likely to cause confusion, mistake and deception in the minds of the public and to lead the public to believe that Applicant's product identified by mark has its source in Opposer or that in some way Opposer is endorsing or sponsoring such product, or that Opposer is in some way associated with Applicant in manufacturing and selling the product so identified.
	6.  Opposer is the owner of Registration No. number for mark, issued on date and renewed, a copy of said Registration being attached hereto and made a part hereof; that said Registration is in full force and effect and has not been cancelled or abandoned; that two copies of such Registration showing status and title will be filed timely during the taking of testimony.
	WHEREFORE, Opposer files this Notice of Opposition and prays that the Application herein opposed be denied; that registration of the mark therein disclosed be refused, and for such other and further relief in the premises as may be deemed to be just and proper.
	The filing fee of $300.00 is presented herewith. (see Guidelines for Firm Charges)
