Dear Contact Greeting:

We have now received word that the above-identified patent application has been published in the official Patent Gazette for Taiwan.  The application was published on  under Publication No. .  The publication period extends for three months from the date of publication, during which time others may oppose issuance of the patent.  If no opposition is lodged against the application within the publication period, then the Letters Patent will be issued upon payment of the sealing fee and the first and second year annuities.  

Unless we hear to the contrary, our associates in Taiwan will automatically pay the sealing fee and the first and second year annuities upon expiration of the publication period, assuming that no opposition has been filed.

If you have contrary instructions or would like to discuss this matter further, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney

Enclosure
