Dear Contact Greeting:

We are writing to report that the above-referenced Hong Kong application has been published on [Insert Publication Date] as Publication No. [Insert Publ. No.].  If you would like a copy, please let us know.

Our foreign associate has also informed us that the first maintenance fee deadline for this application is [Insert Annuity due date].  We will, of course, send a reminder closer to this deadline.

In addition, our foreign associate has told us that we will need to file a request for registration or grant within 6 months of publication of this Hong Kong application or within 6 months of the grant date for its counterpart [Choose one:  European (designating Great Britain), British, or Chinese] Application No. [Application No.______ Our Ref. _________], whichever is the later.  Based on past practice, we have found it better to file this request once the [Choose one:  European, British, or Chinese] patent has been granted.  Our foreign associate will monitor the grant date for the [Choose one:  European, British, or Chinese] patent application to ensure that the request for registration of the Hong Kong application is filed in a timely manner.

As always, please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or comments. 

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
