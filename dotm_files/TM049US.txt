Dear Contact Greeting

The registration of the above-identified mark (copy enclosed) was issued on Registration Date.  To prevent cancellation of a registration by the Patent and Trademark Office, the registrant of a mark must file a declaration that the mark is still in use.  This must be done sometime between the fifth and sixth years after registration.  It is now timely to file such a declaration of use in connection with the above mark.

Please let us know whether or not you are interested in proceeding with this declaration to maintain the registration of this mark.  The cost of preparing and filing such a declaration is estimated at $Firm charge + PTO fee/class.  For your convenience, you may indicate your instructions by checking below at the appropriate box and returning a copy of this letter along with a current use specimen, i.e., pictures of packaging or labels (or advertising material if a service mark) of the mark in use.

We look forward to receiving your instructions.  In the absence of your instructions, we will not file the required declaration and the registration will lapse.

WARNING:  You may receive unsolicited communications from companies requesting fees for trademark related services, such as monitoring and document filing.  Although solicitations from these companies frequently use names similar to the US Patent and Trademark Office, may be official looking, and may display semi-personalized information such as your name and your US trademark application or registration number, the companies who offer those services are not affiliated with the US Patent and Trademark Office or any other federal agency.  These offers are often misleading and typically have no real value.  We do not recommend paying any fees to those types of companies.  If you have any questions regarding unsolicited communications relating to your trademark, please forward any such communications to us.  

INSERT AFTER CLOSING:
☐	This mark is still in use.  Enclosed is a current use specimen.

☐	This mark is no longer  in use.  We do not wish to file a declaration of use for this registration.
