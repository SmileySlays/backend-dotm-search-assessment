Dear Contact Greeting-Foreign Agent:

The U.S. registration of the above-identified mark (copy enclosed) was issued on Registration Date. To prevent cancellation of the U.S. designation by the Patent and Trademark Office, the registrant of a mark must file a Section 71 (8) declaration that the mark is still in use. This must be done some time between the fifth and sixth year after registration. It is now timely to file such a declaration of use in connection with the above mark.

We generally include a Section 15 Declaration if the mark is not the subject of any pending dispute. The acceptance of a Section 15 Declaration makes the mark incontestable except in the event of fraud.

Please let us know whether or not you are interested in proceeding with the Section 71 (8) and 15 Declarations to maintain the US extension of the International Registration. The cost of preparing and filing the combined Declaration is estimated at $400 plus $325 per Class?. For your convenience, you may indicate your instructions by checking below at the appropriate box and returning a copy of this letter along with a current use specimen, i.e., pictures of packaging or labels (or advertising material--if a service mark) of the mark in use.

We look forward to receiving your instructions. In the absence of your instructions, we will not file the required declaration and the U.S. designation of the international registration will lapse.

INSERT AFTER CLOSING:
☐	This mark is still in use. Enclosed is a current use specimen.

☐	This mark is no longer in use. We do not wish to file a declaration of use for this registration.
