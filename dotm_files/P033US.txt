Dear congreet:

This is a follow up to our previous correspondence (copy enclosed) concerning the allowance of the above-identified patent application.  Since utility patent terms are now measured from the filing date of the earliest filed application, payment of the issue fee should be made as quickly as possible.  The final deadline for paying the issue fee is ISSUE FEE DEADLINE.

Please fill out and return a copy of the Instruction Sheet to us by 1 MO. PRIOR  ISSUE FEE DUE DATE.  If we do not receive your specific instructions to pay this fee, we will allow this application to become abandoned.

As always, please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.  We appreciate the opportunity of serving you.

Sincerely,



atty
