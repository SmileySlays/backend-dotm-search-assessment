RE:	Request to Update a PCT Application With a Customer Number


Please associate PCT application Number	 [identify only one PCT Application 
Number] with Customer Number No.	 for purposes of viewing the PCT Application in 
Private PAIR.


I understand that a Customer Number cannot be used in the international phase of a PCT application to designate the correspondence address for a PCT application or to appoint an attorney or agent in a power of attorney.  Any changes to the correspondence address must be made separately in writing in accordance with PCT Rule 92bis.
	
	
For the PCT application listed above, I am:

      	An applicant




A registered attorney or agent named in the originally filed PCT Request (Form PCT/RO/101) and there is no attorney or agent of record

Respectfully submitted,


	
Working Attorney, Registration No. Reg. No. 		

Recognizing that Internet communications are not secure, I hereby authorize the USPTO to communicate with me concerning any subject matter of this customer number update request by electronic mail.
