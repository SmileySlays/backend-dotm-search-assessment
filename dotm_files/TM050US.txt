Dear Name/DNC/Contact Greeting-Correspondence Address:

We have prepared and are enclosing a Declaration Under Sections 8 & 15 for the subject mark.

Sections 8 and 15 documents can be executed in the form of an affidavit or a declaration.  Most clients prefer to use the declaration format, since it avoids the necessity of getting a signature notarized.  The rules require that, in the absence of an affidavit, the person signing a declaration must be advised of the legal importance of it.  Accordingly, the document must show recognition of such importance by including a statement regarding the penalty for willful false statements.  That is the reason that such language appears in this document.  

Please read the declaration carefully and if everything therein is correct, date and sign it and return it to us for filing in the Patent and Trademark Office.  Also, please enclose two specimens per class of use showing use of the mark thereon.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney

Enclosure
