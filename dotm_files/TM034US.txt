Dear Correspondence Address:

We are pleased to report that the Statement of Use filed in the above-identified trademark application has been accepted.  A copy of the Notice of Acceptance is enclosed.

The only remaining step is for the Patent and Trademark Office to issue the Certificate of Registration for the mark.  We will forward the Certificate to you as soon as we receive it, which we expect will be in about 6 to 8 weeks.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
