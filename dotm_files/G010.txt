*An application qualifies for a lower government fee in certain applications if the application has not been assigned or licensed to a large entity and there is no obligation to do so. Generally, a large entity is one having more than 500 employees (including all affiliates), excluding certain not-for-profit organizations and educational institutions. Please check the proper box to ensure that the proper fee amount will be paid.
