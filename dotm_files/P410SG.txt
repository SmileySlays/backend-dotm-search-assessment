Dear Name/DNC/Correspondence Address-Contact Greeting:

We are pleased to enclose the Letters Patent Certificate for the above-identified Singapore case.  The term of the patent is twenty years from the international filing date of the PCT; therefore, assuming all annuities are paid, the patent will expire on date.  The next annuity will be due date and annually thereafter through the duration of the patent.

While there is no legal requirement for marking, it is advisable to mark the products made in accordance with the patented invention, as well as associated packaging and literature, with “Singapore Patent No. Diary Field/Patent, Registration No.”.  Failure to do so means a patentee may not be able to recover damages for infringement.  

Please note that the invention must be worked in Singapore on a commercial scale and to the fullest extent possible within three years from the date of grant of the patent or four years from the date of filing the application, whichever is later.  If this does not occur, the patent may be left open to grant of a compulsory license.

Please acknowledge receipt of the enclosed Patent Certificate by signing below and returning a copy of this letter to us.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. 

Sincerely,



Team Member/Working Attorney
