Dear Contact Greeting:

About eight months have passed since the above-referenced patent application was filed in the United States. If you have any interest in pursuing patent protection outside of the United States, important advantages may be obtained by filing corresponding foreign patent applications within one year of the United States filing date. In addition, if you have modified the invention since the filing date, this may be an appropriate time to include claims and a description of the modifications.

In order to provide sufficient time for us to prepare the necessary documents, secure the required signatures, obtain foreign translations of the United States application, and to minimize our foreign associates' charges, please let us have your instructions by no later than Term 550-60 by returning the enclosed instruction form. By that date we will need to know the foreign countries of interest so that we may complete all of the necessary steps well in advance of the one year anniversary of the United States filing date. For your convenience, we have enclosed a "Foreign Patent Instruction Sheet" for you to check the countries in which patent protection is desired.

ADD THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH FOR INDIVIDUAL INVENTORS OR FOR  SMALL ENTITY CLIENTS TO DISCUSS COSTS: 
Foreign filing of applications varies in cost from country to country. If you wish to foreign file but would like an approximate quote before proceeding with the  applications, please select the appropriate check box on the instruction sheet form and  return it along with a copy of the Foreign Patent Instruction Sheet indicating the countries in  which you are interested. 

We appreciate your assistance and look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
