Dear Contact Greeting:

The term of the subject US design patent is nearly complete and the patent will soon expire. Accordingly, you need to review the current use (i.e., marking) of this patent number in connection with your products. More specifically, we advise you to identify the products currently being marked with this patent number, as well as any product literature which references this patent. 

It is advisable to remove the subject patent number from the corresponding products as soon as practical after the patent expires. The Federal Circuit has allowed for a reasonable time in removing the expired patent numbers, i.e., waiting until after molds or dies with the patent number wear out before they are replaced. However, there is likely less latitude with regard to printed materials associated with the product and which include the patent number.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding patent marking, please let us know.
 
Sincerely,



Working Attorney
