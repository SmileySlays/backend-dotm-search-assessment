Dear Contact Greeting:

We are pleased to report that the above-identified patent application was published on Publication Date under International Publication No. Publication Number.  Enclosed is a copy of the application as published.

WARNING:  You may receive unsolicited communications from companies requesting payment of patent-related fees, such as monitoring, publication, document filing, or similar activities.  Although solicitations from these companies frequently are official looking and may display semi-personalized information, such as your name and PCT application number, the companies who offer those services are not affiliated with WIPO or any government agency.  These offers are often misleading and typically have no real value.  We do not recommend paying fees to these types of companies.  If you have questions regarding unsolicited communications relating to your patent application, please forward any such communications to us.
