Dear Name/DNC/Correspondence Address-Contact Greeting:

We are pleased to enclose the Letters Patent Certificate for the above-identified South African case.  The term of the patent is twenty years from the date of filing, therefore expiring on date.  The first annuity will be due three years from the date of filing the application and then annually thereafter throughout the duration of the patent.

Please note that the invention must be worked in South Africa so that it satisfies the reasonable requirements of the public.  Failure to do so can expose the patent to an application by an interested party for a compulsory license under the patent.  Nominal working may be performed from time to time, but it is doubtful whether or not nominal workings can successfully avoid the grant of a compulsory license.  Our foreign associates recommend that nominal workings be performed only if it is desired to sell the patent or grant licenses thereunder.

Please acknowledge receipt of the enclosed Patent Certificate by signing below and returning a copy of this letter to us.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,



Case Data/Team Member/Working Attorney

Enclosure

After the closing, add the following:


Receipt of the above-identified South African Patent is confirmed.
