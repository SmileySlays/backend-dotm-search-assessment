Dear Contact Greeting-Foreign Agent:

We are pleased to report that the Sections 8 & 15 Declaration, confirming the continuing use and incontestability of the above-identified mark, has been accepted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The US extension of your International Registration will therefore remain in good standing until ten years from the US registration date.

An additional Section 8 Declaration attesting to continued use of the mark must be filed within six months prior to the tenth anniversary of the US registration. This Section 8 Declaration is in addition to the renewal of the International Registration which must be filed through the International Bureau.

Although we will mark our docket for the Section 8 deadline, we suggest that you include this deadline in a docket of due dates in your own records, so that it will come up for attention sufficiently in advance of the deadline for appropriate steps to be taken at that time.

Enclosed is a copy of the acknowledgement and acceptance notice.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
