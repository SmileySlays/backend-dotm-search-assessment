Dear Contact Greeting:

This is a follow-up to our previous correspondence (copy enclosed) regarding the third maintenance fee due on the above-identified patent.  Failure to pay the maintenance fee will cause the patent to expire.  

If you allow this patent to expire, please be sure to remove the subject patent number from your product, packaging of your product, and on any printed materials associated with the product.  If you have any questions or concerns regarding patent marking, please let us know.

If we do not hear otherwise from you, we will not pay the maintenance fee, and we will allow the patent to expire.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
