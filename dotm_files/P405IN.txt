Dear Contact Greeting:

We are writing to you with regard to the working requirements in India regarding the above patent.  In India, it is required that every patent owner and licensee file each year by March 31 a statement of the extent to which the patented invention has been worked on a commercial scale in India in the previous calendar year.  If working has taken place during the previous year in respect of your patent, we can file a statement to this effect.  The information required to file this statement is as follows:

a.	Quantum and value (in Rupees) of the patented product;
b.	Manufactured in India or imported from other countries;
c.	Licenses and sub-licenses granted during the year;
d.	Whether public requirement has been met partly/adequately/to the fullest extent at reasonable price.

If there has only been importation of the patent product, this does not qualify in India as working, but you may wish to file a statement anyway.  If we do not receive instructions to file a statement, our associates will file a “nil” statement at no additional cost to you.  Whether a no statement or a nil statement is filed, there is a possibility of compulsory licensing to a third party.

Please let us have your instructions regarding this matter as soon as possible.  Please let us know if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
