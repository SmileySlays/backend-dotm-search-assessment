Dear Name/DNC/Correspondence Address-Contact Greeting:

We are pleased to confirm that the above-identified patent application was filed in Poland and assigned Serial No. number.  The filing date in Poland is deemed to be the International Filing date of date.  However, this application claims priority from the counterpart U.S. application, and therefore has an effective filing date of date.

We will report further on this application as the case progresses.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

Sincerely,



Case Data/Team Member/Working Attorney
