Dear Name/DNC/Contact Greeting-Correspondence Address:

We have received and enclose a copy of an Office Action from the U.S. Trademark Office concerning examination of the above-identified case.  

We are pleased to report that the examining attorney has reported that there are no similar registered or pending marks which would bar registration of this mark.  However, the examining attorney has rejected the application on the grounds that the mark is considered to be “merely descriptive.”  Further details on this ground for rejection are contained in the office action.  

Please consider this office action and let us have your instructions on how to proceed.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney

Enclosure
