Dear Contact Greeting:

About eight months have passed since the above-referenced provisional patent application was filed in the United States. It is now timely to consider regular application filings in both the US and foreign countries. Both the US and foreign applications must be filed within one year after the provisional application filing date to retain the benefit of that filing date.

If you wish to pursue patent protection in the United States based on this provisional application, it is necessary to prepare and file a regular patent application. The regular application can have the same text as the provisional application, but in many cases it may be advantageous to include any improvements made since the filing of the provisional, and/or any additional data supporting the breadth of the desired claims. We are therefore writing now to ask for your instructions regarding the filing of a regular patent application on this case to ensure sufficient time to prepare and submit such an application. Please feel free to provide your instructions by checking appropriate boxes on the attached form and returning a copy to our office by Term 550-60 days.

If you have any interest in pursuing patent protection outside of the United States, important advantages may be obtained by filing corresponding foreign patent applications by the above-noted anniversary date. To pursue foreign applications, we will need time to prepare formal filing documents and secure the required signatures, and also to obtain translations of the application into appropriate foreign languages. Also, many of our foreign associates increase their charges as the filing deadline approaches. We therefore also ask for your instructions regarding possible foreign filings for this application, including a designation of the countries of interest. For your convenience, we are attaching a foreign filing list which you can use for responding on the issue of foreign filings.

We look forward to your instructions. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or wish to discuss these matters further before providing your instructions on how to proceed.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
