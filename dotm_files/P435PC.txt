Dear Name/DNC/Correspondence Address-Contact Greeting:

	The above-identified PCT patent application will publish on , which will disclose the described invention to the public.  If the invention has not yet been publicly disclosed, it is still possible that an application could be filed outside the United States.  However, once the PCT application is published, this opportunity will no longer exist.  

	Since the case has already been foreign filed, we assume that you have already proceeded for those countries in which you have an interest.  However, if you want to consider filing in additional countries, and if the invention has not already been disclosed to the public, then we need to have your instructions as soon as possible and certainly no later than the publication date for the PCT case.  

	As always, please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further.  In the absence of your instructions, we will assume that no additional foreign filings are desired. 

						Sincerely,



						Team Member/Working Attorney
