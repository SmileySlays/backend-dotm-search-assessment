Dear Contact Greeting:

We are pleased to report that on Filing Date we filed, on your behalf, a provisional patent application on CASE TITLE with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  For your convenience, we have enclosed a copy of the application as filed.  

The filing of this provisional application establishes a priority date for the disclosed subject matter for future patent applications in the US and for foreign filing.  A patent will not issue from this provisional application.  In order to pursue a US patent and retain the benefit of the filing date of this provisional application, a regular utility application must be filed within one year of the filing date of this application.  

Please let us know as soon as you have made a decision and are in a position to proceed with a regular patent application for this case.  In the absence of your instructions, we will follow up in about eight months.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
