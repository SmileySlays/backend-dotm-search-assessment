STATEMENT UNDER 37 CFR 1.55 OR 1.78 FOR AIA (FIRST INVENTOR TO FILE) TRANSITION APPLICATIONS
☐	This application (1) claims priority to or the benefit of an application filed before March 16, 2013 and (2) also contains, or contained at any time, a claim to a claimed invention that has an effective filing date on or after March 16, 2013.

AUTHORIZATION OR OPT-OUT OF AUTHORIZATION TO PERMIT ACCESS

When this Application Data Sheet is properly signed and filed with the application, Applicant has provided written authority to permit a participating foreign intellectual property (IP) office access to the instant application-as-filed (see paragraph A in subsection 1 below) and the European Patent Office (EPO) access to any search results from the instant application (see paragraph B in subsection 1 below).

Should applicant choose not to provide an authorization identified in subsection 1 below, application must opt-out of the authorization by checking the corresponding box A or B or both in subsection 2 below.

NOTE:  This section of the Application Data Sheet is ONLY reviewed and processed with the INITIAL filing of an application.  After the initial filing of an application, an Application Data Sheet cannot be used to provide or rescind authorization for access by a foreign IP office(s).  Instead, Form PTO/SB/39 or PTO/SB/69 must be used as appropriate.

1.         Authorization to Permit Access by a Foreign Intellectual Property Office(s)

A.        Priority Document Exchange (PDX) – Unless box A in subsection 2 (opt-out of authorization) is checked, the undersigned hereby grants the USPTO authority to provide the European Patent Office (EPO), the Japan Patent Office (JPO), the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO), the State Intellectual Property Office of the People’s Republic of China (SIPO), the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and any other foreign intellectual property office participating with the USPTO in a bilateral or multilateral priority document exchange agreement in which a foreign application claiming priority to the instant patent application is filed, access to:  (1) the instant patent application-as-filed and its related bibliographic data, (2) any foreign or domestic application to which priority or benefit is claimed by the instant application and its related bibliographic data, and (3) the date of filing of this Authorization.  See 37 CFR 1.14(h)(1).

B.        Search Results from U.S. Application to EPO – Unless box B in subsection 2 (opt-out of authorization) is checked, the undersigned hereby grants the USPTO authority to provide the EPO access to the bibliographic data and search results from the instant patent application when a European patent application claiming priority to the instant patent application is filed.  See 37 CFR 1.14(h)(2).
The applicant is reminded that the EPO’s Rule 141(1) EPC (European Patent Convention) requires applicants to submit a copy of the search results from the instant application without delay in a European patent application that claims priority to the instant application.

2.         Opt-Out of Authorizations to Permit Access by a Foreign Intellectual Property Office(s)

☐        A.  Applicant DOES NOT authorize the USPTO to permit a participating foreign IP office access to the instant application-as-filed.  If this box is checked, the USPTO will not be providing a participating foreign IP office with any documents and information and identified in subsection 1A above.

☐        B.  Applicant does not authorize the USPTO to transmit to the EPO any search results from the instant patent application.  If this box is checked, the USPTO will not be providing the EPO with search results from the instant application.

NOTE:  Once the application has published or is otherwise publicly available, the USPTO may provide access to the application in accordance with 37 CFR 1.14.
