Dear Contact Greeting:

Most Roland Philadelphia items are uploaded via First to File, but if it is a general follow up or question (e.g., something that does not need to be Docketed), email follow up with the attorney is acceptable (remove the "Via First to File" sentence above).



Sincerely,



Working Attorney
