BASED ON A BONA FIDE INTENT TO USE THE MARK IN COMMERCE
In completing this Worksheet, “bona fide intent” to use the mark in interstate commerce means that, as of the filing date of the application, actual use has not occurred but you are intending to use this mark on the goods by applying the mark directly to the goods or to the packaging for the goods (for a trademark), or, for a service mark, an intent to use the mark in print with a description of the services being offered.

United States Trademark Specimens

A “specimen” is a real-life sample of how you are using your mark. The Trademark Office requires specimens as proof of your actual usage of the mark. There are four (4) requirements for a specimen:

1.	It must show the mark as shown in your application/registration.

2.	It must be a brand that identifies your goods, not merely your company name.

3.	The specimen must have been actually “used” (i.e., goods sold or transported) in interstate commerce as of the date that we are representing to the Trademark Office.

4.	A separate specimen is required for each class of goods (but is not required for each good within a class).
 

The following tables summarize what is, and is not, generally acceptable as a specimen:
