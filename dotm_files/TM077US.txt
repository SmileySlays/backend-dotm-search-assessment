Dear Contact Greeting:

Enclosed for your information is a copy of the abstract of the publication of the above mark as it appeared in the US Trademark Official Gazette.  Under the trademark laws, any interested party may oppose the registration any time within 30 days after publication.  We have so far received no indication that anyone intends to oppose your registration.  We will continue to keep you advised.  

WARNING:  You may receive unsolicited communications from companies requesting fees for trademark related services, such as monitoring and document filing.  Although solicitations from these companies frequently use names similar to the US Patent and Trademark Office, may be official looking, and may display semi-personalized information such as your name and your US trademark application or registration number, the companies who offer those services are not affiliated with the US Patent and Trademark Office or any other federal agency.  These offers are often misleading and typically have no real value.  We do not recommend paying any fees to those types of companies.  If you have any questions regarding unsolicited communications relating to your trademark, please forward any such communications to us.  

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
