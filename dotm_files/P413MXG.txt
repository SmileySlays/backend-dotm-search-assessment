Dear congreet:

The above-identified patent issued on Registration Date.  After three years from this grant date, any person may apply for the grant of a compulsory license to use the invention where it has not been used unless there are duly justified reasons for such non-use.  However, a compulsory license may not be granted by the Mexican Patent Office if the patentee files a proof of working or importation statement or an excuse for non-working.

Accordingly, in order to discourage third parties from requesting a compulsory license, we recommend filing proof of working or an importation statement of the above-referenced invention.  The deadline for filing this information is Foreign Use Due Deadline Term 31400.

To file the proof of working statement, we will need:

1.	the name and address of Mexican licensee who is manufacturing the patented product in Mexico;
2.	the date on which exploitation began; and
3.	the date and registration number of the license agreement recorded at the Mexican Patent Office.

The license must be recorded in the Mexican Patent office to satisfy the working statement requirement.

To file a statement of importation, we will need:

1.	the name and address of the Mexican buyer of the product;
2.	the starting date of importation of the product; and
3.	a copy of an invoice relating to the sale of the product imported into Mexico.

Again, the deadline to file either a Proof of Working Statement or a Statement of Importation in Mexico is Foreign Use Due Deadline Term 31400.  We look forward to receiving your instructions.

Very truly yours,



atty
