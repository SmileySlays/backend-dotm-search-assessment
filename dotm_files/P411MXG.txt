Dear congreet:

We are pleased to enclose the Certificate of Patent for the above-identified patent case in Country.  The term of the patent is twenty years from the date of filing, therefore expiring on .  Annuities are required to be paid in January of every fifth year, covering five years at a time, the first being due on .  We will contact you for instructions regarding payment of the annuities as they come due.

In addition, Mexico has a “working” requirement for the product to be made available to the public in Mexico within three (3) years of patent issuance.  Importation into Mexico of the patented product or of a product made by the patented process is equivalent to working.  Failure to file proof of working (or failure to file a valid excuse for non-working) before Foreign Use Due Term 31400  will open this case for compulsory licensing.  Therefore, we plan to alert you by Foreign Use Due 6 Mo. Prior Term 31410 so that whatever is needed can be done before the deadline, but we strongly recommend that you enter the date in your own calendar to be sure that appropriate steps are taken by that deadline.

If you  have any questions regarding this patent, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Very truly yours,
