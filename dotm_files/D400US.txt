Dear Contact Greeting:

Three months have passed since the above-referenced design patent application was filed in the United States. If you have any interest in pursuing design patent protection outside of the United States, important advantages may be obtained by filing corresponding foreign design patent applications within six months of the United States filing date. In addition, if you have modified the invention since the filing date, this may be an appropriate time to include a description of the modifications.

In order to provide sufficient time for us to prepare the necessary documents, secure the required signatures, obtain foreign translations of the United States design application, and minimize our foreign associates' charges, please let us have your instructions by Term 31700-30 days. For your convenience, we have enclosed a "Foreign Design Patent Instruction Sheet" for you to check the countries in which design patent protection is desired.

We look forward to receiving your instructions. In the meantime, please let us know if you need additional information or estimates for any country of interest to enable you to make your decision. As always, we appreciate the opportunity of serving you.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
