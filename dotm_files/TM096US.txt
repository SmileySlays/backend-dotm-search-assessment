Dear Contact Greeting:

We are pleased to report that the Sections 8 & 15 Declaration, confirming continuing use of the above-identified mark, has been accepted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. This registration will therefore remain in good standing until time for renewal, provided the mark continues to be used. A renewal application should be made within the year preceding the 10th anniversary of the registration (i.e., prior to ), at which time we will also need to submit an affidavit confirming the continuing use of the mark. 

Although we will mark our docket for the renewal deadline, we suggest that you include this deadline in a docket of due dates in your own records, so that it will come up for attention sufficiently in advance of the deadline for appropriate steps to be taken at that time.

Enclosed is a copy of the acknowledgement and acceptance notice.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
