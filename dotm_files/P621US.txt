Interview Summary
The applicant's representative wishes to thank the examiner for the telephonic interview of . The examiner's amendment as attached to the Notice of Allowability is in accordance with the amendments authorized during the interview.

Comments on Statement Of Reasons For Allowance
In the Notice of Allowability, the Examiner included statements regarding reasons for allowance of the claims.  Applicant agrees that the prior art of record fails to teach or render obvious the claims pending in the present application.  However, applicant submits that any statement of reasons for allowance necessarily contains characterizations of the claims or of the prior art which cannot adequately indicate the bases for allowance of the claims.  Accordingly, applicant submits that the stated reasons for allowance do not adequately describe the applicant’s invention as claimed, or the reasons that the claims are allowable over the prior art.
Each claim is allowable because each claim recites a combination of elements not disclosed or suggested by any of the references, taken alone or in combination.  The invention resides in the combination of elements as variously recited in the claims, and not in the presence of any one or a few particular elements or limitations.  Further, it is to be understood that each claim stands on its own merits.
Applicant therefore does not acquiesce to any inference or presumption which may be drawn from the Examiner’s statements regarding the reasons for allowance.  As stated in the MPEP at 1302.14, “[t]he examiner's statement of reasons for allowance is the personal opinion of the examiner as to why the claims are allowable [and the] examiner's statement should not create an estoppel.”    
	Respectfully submitted,
