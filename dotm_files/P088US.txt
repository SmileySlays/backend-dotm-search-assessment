Dear Contact Greeting:

We have recently paid the issue fee in connection with the above-identified patent application.  It is thus timely to consider if any additional patent coverage should be pursued based on the application, the need for which may have come to light as a result from new developments or from a further understanding of features or operations of the invention.  

Any continuing application must be filed on or before the issue date of this case, which date is difficult to ascertain in advance with certainty, given the current practices of the US Patent Office.  Therefore, in order to allow sufficient time for the preparation of any continuing application, please provide us with your instructions as soon as possible.  If you have any questions or wish to discuss this further before deciding how to proceed, please let us know.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
