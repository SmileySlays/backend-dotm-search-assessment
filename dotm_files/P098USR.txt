An annuity service handles maintenance fees on most Roland matters, but there are some for which we pay the fees.

Dear Contact Greeting:

IF ANNUITY SERVICE HANDLES MAINTENANCE FEES
At the time the above-identified patent issued, it was our understanding that all maintenance fees were to be handled by an annuity service on behalf of Roland. We therefore removed all maintenance fee entries from our docket. 

However, as we are still listed as the maintenance fee address for this matter, we received a Maintenance Fee Statement verifying that the payment has been received by the US Patent and Trademark Office. A copy of this Statement has been uploaded to First to File.

IF WE HANDLE MAINTENANCE FEES
We are pleased to confirm that the first/second/third maintenance fee has been paid for the above-identified patent.  A copy of a Maintenance Fee Statement verifying that the payment has been received by the Patent Office has been uploaded to First to File.  

The next maintenance fee will be due .  We will contact you closer to the deadline for your instructions.

As always, should you have any questions or wish to discuss this further, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Best regards,



Working Attorney
