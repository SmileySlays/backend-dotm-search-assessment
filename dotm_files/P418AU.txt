Dear Name/DNC/Correspondence Address-Contact Greeting:

We are pleased to enclose the Deed of Letters Patent for the above-identified patent case in Australia.  The term of the patent is twenty years from the date of lodgment (filing), therefore expiring on Term 87500 Date.  While there is no requirement to mark, it is advisable to mark products made in accordance with the patent, as well as associated packaging and literature, with "Australian Patent No. Patent, Registration No.".  A consequence of not marking is that under certain circumstances a patentee may not be able to recover damages for infringement.

Please note that the invention must be worked in Australia so that it satisfies the reasonable requirements of the public.  Failure to work the invention at any time after three years following sealing (issuance) may leave the patent open to the grant of a compulsory license.  Importation of the patented product or products made abroad by the patented process (if applicable), is regarded as working in Australia.  There is no provision for nominal working.

An annuity must be paid each year to maintain the patent in force until its expiration date. We will send a request for your instructions for payment as the date for the next annuity approaches.

Please acknowledge receipt of the enclosed Patent Certificate by signing below and returning a copy of this letter to us.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. 

Sincerely,



Team Member/Working Attorney
