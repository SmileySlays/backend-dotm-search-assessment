Formalities has reviewed the Filing Receipt in accordance with the attached Filing Receipt Checklist. As a reminder, it is still the responsibility of the attorney to make sure that everything is correct. You will note that in the “ATTY” column there are some items that the attorney specifically needs to double check. 


	No corrections appear to be necessary.


The following items appear to be outstanding as noted on the Filing Receipt Checklist, and we have entered docket dates for those items as noted. These dates can be cleared or extended by you as necessary.
