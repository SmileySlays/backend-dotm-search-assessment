For your convenience, Formalities has reviewed the Filing Receipt in accordance with the attached Filing Receipt Checklist. As a reminder, it is still the responsibility of the attorney to make sure that everything is correct. You will note that in the “Atty.” column there are some items that the attorney specifically needs to double check. 


	No corrections appear to be necessary.


The following items appear to be outstanding as noted on the Filing Receipt Checklist, and we have entered docket dates for those items as noted. These dates can be cleared or extended by you as necessary. 

	Unsigned Oath or Declaration filed 	
	No Assignment submitted to USPTO (docketed 2 months from filing receipt to record Assignment).	
	No Power of Attorney filed (docketed 2 months from filing receipt to file POA).	
	Proper priority claim issue (docketed 4 months from filing to correct).
