Dear Name/DNC/Correspondence Address-Contact Greeting:

This will confirm that a Request for Examination has been filed for the above-identified patent application, and the required examination fee paid.  The Canadian Patent Office will in due course acknowledge receipt of the Request for Examination and should then indicate in general terms when examination will be conducted, which under the current circumstances is approximately two years.  We also expect that the Canadian Patent Office will request the submission of particulars concerning prior art cited in any corresponding United States and European applications, and we will attend to that matter when it arises.  

We will report further as the case progresses.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter further. 

Sincerely,



Team Member/Working Attorney
