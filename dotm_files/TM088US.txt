Dear Name/DNC/Contact Greeting-Correspondence Address:

We have prepared and are enclosing for signature a Statement of Use for filing in the above-referenced application.  Please review the information contained in the Statement for accuracy.  The Statement then needs to be signed and dated, and returned to us for filing with the Trademark Office.  We will also need to have three specimens showing use of the mark.  (Suitable specimens for trademark use would include, e.g., labels applied to the goods or packaging for the goods, or photographs showing the mark applied directly to the goods.  Suitable specimens for a service mark use would include brochures or advertisements using the mark and describing the services.)  

The deadline for filing this Statement is .  We therefore will need to have the executed Statement returned well before that date.  As always, if you have any questions concerning this or any other matter, please do not hesitate to call.


Sincerely,



Working Attorney

Enclosure
