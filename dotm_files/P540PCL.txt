Dear Contact Greeting:

I am writing to report we have received the International Preliminary Report on Patentability (IPRP) in connection with the above PCT application, a copy of which is enclosed for your records.  From our review, the IPRP is essentially the same as the Written Opinion we reported to you on .  This is not surprising since we did not make any Chapter II demand or other response, but it is always good to confirm.  

As you know, we recently nationalized this PCT application in Australia, Canada, Europe, India, South Korea and China as well as already having filed a bypass continuation application in the US.  Accordingly, we have forwarded the IPRP to the foreign associates in each of those cases for appropriate handling as we will do as well.  

So for now, please let me know if you have questions or comments or if I can be of other assistance in any way.

Best regards,



Charles R. Reeves
