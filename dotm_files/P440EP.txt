Dear Contact Greeting:

We have previously forwarded the Certificate of Patent for the above-identified European case.  Upon the granting of European Patents, a notice is published in the European Patent Bulletin to notify others of the grant of a patent and to provide others a period of nine months in which to file an opposition to such patent.  

We are pleased to report that the European Patent Office has now confirmed that no opposition has been filed against the above-identified patent within the prescribed time limit.  The patent will therefore automatically be entered into the Register of European Patents, and no further substantive action will occur with respect to this patent. 

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
