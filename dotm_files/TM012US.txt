Dear Contact Greeting:

The above-identified application has now been on file for approximately three months. If you have any interest in pursuing possible foreign protection, please note that the laws of many foreign countries provide that the first to file to register a mark is entitled to exclusive use of the mark, even if the registrant did not use the mark prior to registration. 

Valuable trademark rights may therefore be lost to others who are first to file in a given country, and your ability to do business in that country may be impaired. On the other hand, a trademark application in a foreign country will be given the benefit of the earlier US filing date, if filed within six months of the US filing date. Therefore, if you desire to register this mark in foreign countries, we should have your instructions by .

If you have any questions or wish to discuss this further, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
