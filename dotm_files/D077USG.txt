Dear Contact Greeting:

We are pleased to enclose the original Country Patent No. number which issued on date based on the subject patent application. Additionally, we have placed an order for  plaques, and we will forward it/them to you as soon as it has been received.

We have checked the patent for significant errors which may have occurred during the printing. This review focused on confirming the accuracy of the drawings and the data on the cover page. We have also skimmed the remainder of the patent text for obvious problems. Please let us know if you notice any errors that we may have missed in the patent that you feel should be addressed.

Once a patent has been granted, it is important that if the patent owner manufactures, uses or sells the patented products, or authorizes others to do so, the products bear the patent number. 

If you have any questions, please let us know. 

Very truly yours,



Working Attorney
