Dear Contact Greeting-Correspondence Address:

We have now received a Final Office Action from the U.S. Trademark Office in the above-referenced application, a copy of which is enclosed for your consideration.  The Examining Attorney was not persuaded by the arguments we presented in our previous response.  

We now have an opportunity to make amendments to the application and/or submit additional arguments in response to the Action.  Because the Action has been made final, however, submitting amendments or arguments does not constitute a complete response unless all issues are overcome to the satisfaction of the Examiner.  If the Examiner continues to maintain the refusal to register, the original six-month deadline for submitting a response remains applicable, and the only complete response would be to appeal the case to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.  The ultimate deadline for responding to this Action is . 

Please let us know how you want to proceed.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney

Enclosure
