Dear Contact Greeting:

We have now received word from the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that the patent on the above-identified application will issue on Issue Date under Patent No. Registration No.. A copy of the Issue Notification is enclosed.

Now that your patent is about to issue, it is time to consider patent marking. Patent marking is a complex issue, so it is advisable that you contact us so that we can discuss what should be marked in light of your issued patent. Generally speaking, any products covered by this patent and marketed in the United States should have the patent number on them, replacing any "Patent Pending" notice previously used based on this application. Patent marking is important because if you do not, you may be significantly limited in the amount of money that you could collect from an infringer. 

In the event that you do begin patent marking, please keep in mind that it is advisable to remove the patent number from any products covered by this patent and any product literature referencing this patent number as soon as practical after this patent expires. Patents typically expire after they have run the length of their term, though they may expire earlier if declared invalid or unenforceable by a court. 

We expect to receive the original patent within a few weeks after the issue date. We will forward the patent to you upon receipt. In the meantime, please let us know if you have any questions concerning this case.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney

Enclosure
