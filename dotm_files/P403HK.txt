Dear Contact Greeting:

We are writing to inform you of the receipt of an official filing receipt (a copy of which is enclosed) in connection with the above-captioned patent application in Hong Kong.  That country’s Patent Office has assigned this application No. Basic Application No. and a filing date of Basic Application Date.

The request to record the designated patent application (Stage 1) will be published in the Hong Kong Government Gazette in approximately six to nine months.  At that time, we will forward you a copy of the publication.  Payment of official maintenance fees will be required about five years after publication of Stage 1, if a Stage 2 application has not yet been filed.  The first maintenance fee will be due five years from the anniversary of the filing date of the basic application which first occurs after the Stage 1 publication.  We will notify you of the deadline when reporting the publication.

We will be in further touch with you as this application is published.  In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. 

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
