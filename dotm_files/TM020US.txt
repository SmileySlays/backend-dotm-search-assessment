Dear Name/DNC/Contact Greeting-Correspondence Address:

The above-identified application has previously been allowed.  Please be advised that the deadline for filing a statement of use or a request for extension of time in this case is .  Please let us know if the mark has been used, or if you wish to continue to pursue this application until use occurs.  

Please also note that it is possible to file a Statement of Use for less than all of the goods identified in the application.  In this situation, the application can be divided into separate applications.  The Statement of Use could then be submitted as to only those goods for which use has been made, and an extension can be obtained to maintain the application for use with the other goods.  The advantage would be to obtain a registration for the mark as to the goods with which the mark has been used, while preserving the ability to obtain a registration for the other goods at a later time.  However, there must still be a bona fide intent to use the mark with the other goods in order to maintain the application, and the same constraints as to time extensions will apply.  Please be sure to consider if this option is applicable in this case.

Please let us have your instructions as soon as possible.

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
