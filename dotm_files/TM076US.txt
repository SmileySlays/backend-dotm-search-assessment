Dear Name/DNC/Contact Greeting-Correspondence Address:

We are pleased to report that the above-identified application has been approved.  The mark was published on date in the Official Gazette for Trademarks.  The purpose of the publication is to provide other parties a period of thirty (30) days in which to oppose registration of the mark.  If the mark is not opposed during that time period, then the application will be allowed.  It will be approximately two months before we learn from the Patent and Trademark Office whether or not anyone has initiated such an opposition proceeding.

We will have a period of six months after the date of allowance in which to file a Statement of Use confirming that the mark has been put into use.  In the absence of such use, this time period is extendable in six-month increments up to a total period of 36 months from the date of allowance.  

We will report further to you on this application upon receipt of any further communications from the Trademark Office.  

Sincerely,



Working Attorney
