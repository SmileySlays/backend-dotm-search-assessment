Dear Name/DNC/Correspondence Address-Contact Greeting:

We are pleased to report that the above-identified patent application has been allowed and the decision has been published in the Brazil Official Bulletin.  We now have until date in which to pay the final official issue fee.  If the issue fee is not paid by that date, the application will be considered abandoned.  Unless we receive instructions to the contrary, we will pay the issue fee on date.

The next course of action for third parties would be to request the administrative nullity of the patent within six months immediately following the date of grant.

As always, if you have any questions, or wish to discuss this matter further before deciding how to proceed, please do not hesitate to contact us. 

Sincerely,



Case Data/Team Member/Working Attorney
