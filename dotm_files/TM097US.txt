Dear Contact Greeting:

This is a note to let you know that it is now timely to renew the above-identified federal registration.  The renewal will avoid expiration of the registration and will keep it in full force and effect for an additional ten years, i.e. until .  A copy of the registration is enclosed for your convenience.  

Renewal of a registration requires that the mark continue to be in use at the time of renewal.  If any of the products/services shown on the enclosed copy of the registration are no longer identified by the mark, please so indicate.  Any of the listed items which are no longer identified by the mark cannot be included in the renewal application.  The estimated charge to prepare and file such an application for renewal will include the Government filing fee of $Check? (per class) and our attorneys' fee of $Check?. (see Guidelines for Firm Charges)

Please return a copy of this letter with your instructions as to how to proceed and enclose a current use specimen for each class.  Appropriate specimens would be pictures of packaging or labels of the mark in use.  In the absence of a response, we will assume that the mark is no longer in use, or that you have decided not to maintain this registration, and we will not prepare a renewal application.

WARNING:  You may receive unsolicited communications from companies requesting fees for trademark related services, such as monitoring and document filing.  Although solicitations from these companies frequently use names similar to the US Patent and Trademark Office, may be official looking, and may display semi-personalized information such as your name and your US trademark application or registration number, the companies who offer those services are not affiliated with the US Patent and Trademark Office or any other federal agency.  These offers are often misleading and typically have no real value.  We do not recommend paying any fees to those types of companies.  If you have any questions regarding unsolicited communications relating to your trademark, please forward any such communications to us.  

Insert after the closing:
☐	We wish to renew the above-identified registration.  Enclosed is a current use specimen.

☐	We do not wish to renew the above-identified registration.
