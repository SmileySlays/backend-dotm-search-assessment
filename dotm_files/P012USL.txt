Dear Contact Greeting :

	I am writing to report that we have received a Notice of Publication of Application indicating that the above application was published on pub date as Publication No. pub number.  Accordingly, we have obtained a copy of the publication and are enclosing it herewith for your records.

	As you know, it is important to note that a patent has not yet issued on this application even though the publication itself looks very similar to an issued patent.  Accordingly, we will keep you informed as the prosecution proceeds and we receive further communications from the US Patent and Trademark Office.  We will also continue to keep in contact with and work with the inventors on this prosecution and any other developments that may occur.

	Otherwise, as always please get back to me if you have any questions or comments on this application now or at any time.  Please also do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of more help in any way.

						Best regards,



						Supervising Attorney
